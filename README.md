<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening in the world right now. In Canada, Justin Trudeau just accused India of assassinating a Sikh leader in British Columbia. Meanwhile in the US, Congress is facing a potential government shutdown if they can’t agree on border controls and spending cuts. The US has also reached $33 trillion in debt for the first time. 

In Ukraine, evidence suggests that a missile failed to hit its intended target, killing people on a busy street. President Zelensky is trying to make it seem like Washington’s aid isn’t being wasted by cleaning house in the country’s corruption-plagued defense ministry. Donald Trump is countering Joe Biden’s moves by wooing striking union members in Detroit next week despite missing the 2nd Republican debate.

Police have arrested a 29-year-old suspect for the ambush shooting of a Los Angeles County deputy this past weekend. People from flood-ravaged Libya are demanding accountability and are calling for an international investigation. Scientists have put together a list of measurable qualities to tell if an AI is conscious or not. Lastly, while Ghana has gone bankrupt and received their 17th IMF rescue since 1957, Hollywood strikes caused thousands of UK film crews to lose work. Ken Paxton was acquitted by Texas Senate on charges of abuse of office and corruption but still faces trial on securities fraud charge and federal corruption investigation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
