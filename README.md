<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there have been a number of concerning events happening around the world. In the US, former president Donald Trump is putting pressure on Republicans to endorse him and has potentially been involved with receiving millions of dollars from foreign entities. On top of this, there was the deadly attack on the US Capitol by far-right extremists, leading to hundreds of arrests and long prison sentences. Sadly, in other parts of the world people are facing similar struggles. Pro-Iran militia groups and ISIS are responsible for terror attacks in Iraq and Iran that have killed over 84 people. It&#39;s a tense and uncertain time, but thankfully there are ways for us to take good care and live long and healthy lives no matter what is happening in the world!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
