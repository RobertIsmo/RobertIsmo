<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is going through a difficult time right now. In the US, California is dealing with storm damage that could cost over $1 billion. Europe experienced its hottest summer ever and the US saw Biden Lawyers find classified material at his former office. On the other side of the world in Peru, violence has caused 46 deaths and in Ukraine there are talks of providing &quot;security guarantees&quot;. Stateside, New York State is looking for solutions to crime, housing and mental health issues. All of this comes as global temperatures have been reaching record highs.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
