<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, there&#39;s a lot going on right now. An appeals court ruled that the lawyer for former president Donald Trump has to turn over documents in an inquiry. There was a grand jury hearing about Trump evidence but what exactly happened remains unclear. Additionally, the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates as part of efforts to fight inflation and stabilize banks.

In other parts of the world, Japan is exploring ways to make geothermal power cheaper and cleaner. Ukrainian President Zelensky visited Bakhmut in a morale-boosting trip. Meanwhile, the city of Jackson Mississippi is facing a water crisis due to one pip leaking 5 million gallons of water a day.

Finally, back in the US, striking school workers in Los Angeles have parents on their side and winter storms are causing major damage throughout California, with at least five people killed by falling trees and rare tornadoes also touching down. Florida Governor DeSantis recently made some comments about the Russian-Ukrainian conflict that some perceived as favorable to Russia but he clarified them shortly afterwards by calling Putin a &#39;war criminal&#39;.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
