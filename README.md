<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few big stories happening in the US right now. President Biden has unveiled his budget which Republicans have already rejected, and there is an upcoming clash between the two parties on the horizon. In New York, $1.2 billion is being allocated to big transit projects like the Second Avenue Subway extension and new Hudson River train tunnels. The Kremlin is seeking to reset Russia&#39;s institutions with militaristic policies and a singer is growing rich as he chooses which side of this argument to support. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been hospitalized after tripping at a Washington hotel. Senator Fetterman from Pennsylvania is undergoing treatment whilst managing his senate operations from Walter Reed hospital for severe clinical depression. Sociologist research suggests poverty in America persists due to issues with employment and wages, whilst records show that Fox News amplified former President Trump’s election fraud claims despite privately mocking them internally. Jenna Ellis has also recently admitted to falsely representing Trump’s fraud claims in an attempt to appeal to viewers, but Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott&#39;s work has been defended by Lachlan Murdoch. Finally, rare book librarians insist that bare hands are best when handling ancient books; however, few people will take their advice seriously.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
