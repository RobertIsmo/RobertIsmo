<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of different things happening around the world. In the US, Republicans are seeking to expand gun rights and regulate district attorneys, while in Ukraine there is still ongoing trench warfare in the front line. South Korea is exporting billions in arms, but not to Ukraine, and Russian forces are attacking an eastern Ukrainian city. A.I. software is being tested for breast cancer detection in Hungary and Paris experts are model restoration projects for the Notre Dame cathedral. On the business side of things, theaters are experimenting with ticket prices, employers are using personality tests to manage hybrid workforces, and office personalities are becoming more popular to assess employees. Finally, Fox News had a panic after the 2020 election as they felt they could have had higher ratings had they called Arizona sooner. And back in Ohio Island, Put-in-Bay is struggling due to a lack of ice this winter season.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
