<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some tense political situations that have been making headlines lately. In the US, Ron DeSantis&#39; Never Back Down super PAC C.E.O. recently resigned due to internal disputes. There is also a political newcomer in the US running for a Senate seat in Michigan who says he was offered $20 million to challenge Rashida Tlaib. On the international stage, intense negotiations between Israel and Hamas have been taking place in order to reach an agreement for a hostage deal and temporary cease-fire, and the US is pressing Israel to set up safe areas for Palestinians during this pause in war. Additionally, there has been a fiery crash at the Canadian border that has alarmed both Ottawa and Washington. Lastly, OpenAI made news when their C.E.O., Sam Altman was pushed out of the company then rehired shortly after, prompting discussions from both tech leaders and press as well as a podcast titled &quot;(Yet Another) Emergency Pod: Sam Altman is Back&quot;.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
