<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few major things happening in the world right now. Firstly, Silicon Valley Bank has failed after coming under pressure from venture capital customers, which has caused concern about other banks as well. The US economy is continuing to add jobs despite rising interest rates and this has given the Federal Reserve mixed signals on what to do this March. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has caused the stock markets to drop sharply. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Iran have agreed to restore diplomatic ties, which could have larger implications for the Middle East region. On the domestic front, former President Donald Trump is facing several investigations by federal and state prosecutors, so it remains to be seen if he will be indicted eventually. Lastly, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis visited Iowa recently and revealed some of his campaigning strategies. Additionally, the Biden administration&#39;s new policies regarding migrants at the border has reduced crossings but it has also caused headaches with bureaucracy. Finally, Valparaiso University wants to raise money by selling artwork from its museum in order to renovate dormitories due to declining enrollment numbers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
