<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, former President Donald Trump has been barred from running in the 2024 presidential election by a Colorado court following his involvement in an attempted insurrection. People are feeling uneasy about the prospects of a legal battle for the presidency. 

Meanwhile, China has been quietly rebuilding a secretive nuclear testing site, and in Gaza and the Red Sea region, the Houthis militia is carrying out attacks connected to Israel and vowing not to back down until the siege in Gaza ends. 

In response to rising anti-migrant sentiment around Europe, an EU deal on migration has been reached after years of wrangling. However, President Emmanuel Macron&#39;s coalition recently fractured during a vote to overhaul immigration policies. 

Here in New York City, Jews have been feeling increasingly tense with targeted protests and antisemitism spilling onto its streets. In one instance, a woman set out to free her father who had been wrongly convicted of killing her father - which became a decades-long mission. 

Lastly, scientists are exploring whether new diabetes and weight-loss drugs (Ozempic) could be used to treat addiction, kidney disease and more. Also recently revealed was that financial problems were a focus of the FBI&#39;s inquiry into Rudolph W. Giuliani&#39;s efforts to oust the American ambassador to Ukraine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
