<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is facing a lot of unrest right now. In France, protesters are denouncing the police shooting of a 17-year-old in Paris and over 600 people have been arrested after three days of protests. In North America, dangerous heat waves and heavy wildfire smoke have sickened people and spread across the continent. Hundreds of American firefighters are helping out with Canadian wildfires. In the US, a jury acquitted a deputy responsible for inaction during the Parkland shooting and some schools are bringing back police officers to their campuses due to parental concerns over campus violence. Finally, the Koch network has raised over $70 million for the push to sink Trump in 2024.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
