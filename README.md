<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The United Auto Workers (U.A.W.) are getting ready to go on strike if no contract deals are reached before the deadline, potentially causing problems for automakers like Ford and General Motors. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of a trading platform, is currently preparing for his upcoming criminal trial next month. On top of that, House Speaker McCarthy just pulled back a bill for Pentagon spending, making it more likely the U.S government will shut down soon. There’s also been some trouble with Hunter Biden, who was recently indicted on gun charges, as well as President Biden criticizing Republicans for their attempts to cut working-class Americans&#39; funding. Lastly, there have been devastating floods in Libya that have caused many casualties and damage; Ukraine has intensified its attacks against Russia in Crimea and the Black Sea; and President Zelensky will be visiting Washington in the near future.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
