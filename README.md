<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on in the world right now. The coastal cities in the US are becoming too expensive for low-wage workers to stay, so even college graduates are beginning to migrate away. In other news, after four years of investigating, the Trump-era special counsel has released a final report denouncing the Russia investigation. Also, a former US embassy employee is being held in Moscow and charged with conspiracy. Moving on to turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is likely headed for his first ever presidential runoff vote due to a struggling economy and earthquakes. There&#39;s also environmental DNA research that is being conducted by scientists, but it raises some privacy concerns as it can be used to glean information about Human populations and individuals. Lastly, President Biden and congressional leaders will be resuming talks in order to avoid the US defaulting on payments due to an expiring debt limit.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
