<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In Israel, Hamas and Israel have agreed to a cease-fire after prodding from the US. There has also been a fatal bridge crash in Niagara Falls, sparking fears of terror which turned out to be unfounded. Meanwhile, in Russia, Finland has closed its borders in response to an influx of migrants and asylum seekers. On a more positive note, one man left his town millions of dollars in his will after living a frugal life. All in all, it&#39;s been an interesting mix of news!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
