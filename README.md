<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is going on in the world right now! Former President Trump&#39;s fraud trial has started, and he&#39;s trying to turn it around to rally up support. In American politics, Speaker Kevin McCarthy&#39;s speakership in the House of Representatives is under threat due to a follower making threats to remove him, while in Russia US officials say Putin may be targeting US policies which could have to do with Ukraine. There are also reports that Russia might be planning to test a nuclear-powered missile. On a more positive note, the Nobel Prize was awarded recently to Covid vaccine pioneers and unfortunately the &quot;Mother of the Atomic Bomb&quot; never won one due to her identity. In other news, California Governor Newsom named Laphonza Butler as Dianne Feinstein&#39;s successor for Senate and NASA announced a plan for people to possibly live on the moon by 2040. Additionally, crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried is having his court hearing and New York City is facing billions of dollars in financial pressures which could worsen inequality in their school system. Finally, Pope Francis has opened up discussion topics debating married priests and the blessings of gay couples at this week&#39;s Vatican Assembly.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
