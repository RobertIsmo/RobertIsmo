<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hi Friend! There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. President Biden recently gave the State of the Union address and made appeals to work with Republicans on expanding the economy. In Turkey, video footage shows rescue operations after a deadly earthquake at the epicenter near Hatay Province. In Ukraine, there&#39;s a mobile clinic providing healthcare services to rural areas that were once occupied by Russian forces as fighting continues nearby. In Memphis, TN, six officers have been fired and charged with murder in relation to a man they manhandled and beat, Tyre Nichols. And in sports news, LeBron James recently became the all-time career scoring leader in NBA history! Lastly, singer SZA is facing success with her new music and Lindsay Clancy is due in court for charges relating to the murder of her young children.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
