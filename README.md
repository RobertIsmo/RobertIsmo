<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of political turmoil in the US with the Supreme Court disqualifying former president Donald Trump from holding office again. Senate Republicans have also criticized his talk on immigrants, which has sparked more debate. In the House, there has been a lot of discord and dysfunction with more voting but less lawmaking compared to past years. They only managed to pass 27 bills that became law for the year. As for other matters in the US, Congress delayed providing assistance to Ukraine until next year, housing aid has hit its lowest level in 25 years, and college football is taking over housing markets across the country. 

In world news, there has been a rise of influence from the Houthi militia in Yemen as they&#39;ve increased their ship attacks on the Red Sea. Meanwhile, Ukraine&#39;s counteroffensive against Russia hasn&#39;t had much success, but President Zelensky is insistent that Ukraine will prevail. Finally, there are some interesting things going on with how people read books - there are &#39;reading parties&#39; now where guests can chat about the books they brought and join strangers.</p>

<h3>The 27 Bills That Became Law in 2023</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
