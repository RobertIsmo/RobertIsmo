<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there has been a lot of political activity in the US. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had a meeting to try to make a deal on the debt limit, but they could not come to an agreement. There is also a big focus on climate change as there have been breakthrough deals made pertaining to the Colorado River, which is in danger of going dry due to overuse and drought. In eastern Ukraine, drone footage of the war-torn city of Bakhmut shows the destruction that it has experienced. 

In New York City, former president Donald Trump is being sued by E. Jean Carroll for public denials that he sexually abused her and his companies are being investigated by a special counsel about foreign business deals. In addition, there is a legal battle over releasing the writings of a mass shooter who attacked a Christian school in Nashville and NYC employers are starting to become more aware of and accommodating towards menopause friendly workplaces.

On another note, Britain&#39;s most famous literary son Martin Amis has recently been discussed amongst critics.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
