<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening right now in the world. President Biden has announced his re-election bid, defying both President Trump and history. He has also named Julie Chávez Rodríguez as his campaign manager. There has been speculation about who will run for President in 2024 too. In terms of media coverage, after Carlson and Lemon exit from Fox News and CNN, it marks a shift from the Trump-era coverage. There have also been some unexpected changes, with Tucker Carlson&#39;s sudden departure from Fox News and Don Lemon&#39;s ousting from CNN leaving them both &#39;stunned&#39;. Moreover, Ukraine is facing an immense spring offensive that could define the future of their war. To top it off, Dr Fauci recently reflected on the pandemic in an interview and there will be a new natural history museum exhibiting butterflies in New York too. On top of that, former President Trump is being taken to trial over rape allegations by E. Jean Carroll.</p>

<h3>As Carlson and Lemon Exit, a Chapter Closes on Cable’s Trump War</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
