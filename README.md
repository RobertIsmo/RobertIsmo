<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Israel, there&#39;s a military strategy to eradicate Hamas that has been making progress but international condemnation over civilian casualties is growing. Meanwhile in Gaza, there have been thousands of children killed in the current conflict, with the Israeli military claiming to take &quot;all feasible precautions&quot; to avoid more deaths. On the technology front, Sam Altman recently left his post at OpenAI after everything seemed to be going his way. He does however have plans for potentially changing the world as we know it. In education, the American College Board is trying to increase access to advanced placement tests even though many students failed them, often leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. In India, some people are finding unlikely ways out of oppressive patriarchal systems through marriage. Space X has been attempting launches of giant moon and mars rockets with varying success, and banks have been shunning sex workers despite their work being legal, leaving many without accounts. In Las Vegas, they&#39;re hosting F1 events accompanied by long-term nuisances for locals, while Pablo Escobar&#39;s cocaine hippos are now being sterilized in Colombia to protect the country&#39;s ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Is Israel’s Military Strategy to Eradicate Hamas Working?</h3>
<sub>By Eric Schmitt, Ronen Bergman and Adam Goldman</sub>
<p>Israel is making progress in ground control of Gaza, but it has not vanquished Hamas or freed most of the hostages.

<h3>The War Turns Gaza Into a ‘Graveyard’ for Children</h3>

<h3>Chapter 5: An Unlikely Escape Route</h3>

<h3>Sex Workers Have Been Shunned by Banks, Even When Their Work Is Legal</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
