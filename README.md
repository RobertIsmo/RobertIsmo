<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. The G7 countries are looking to counter China by borrowing its economic playbook and spending trillions on a new climate-friendly energy economy. Biden recently paid silent tribute to victims of the Hiroshima bombing, and China is struggling with record-high youth unemployment due to an uneven economic recovery from the pandemic. In Greece, the Coast Guard was caught on video abandoning asylum seekers on a raft at sea. Jordan Neely recently died in NYC after being choked by police. There&#39;s an August timetable in Georgia for charges related to Trump inquiries, and Manhattan district attorney is investigating his ally Allen Weisselberg again. New York congressman Jamaal Bowman is speaking out against Republicans in Congress like Marjorie Taylor Greene, and American semiconductor companies are facing a challenge of not enough workers to fill thousands of open positions due to billions of federal dollars. Amazon is becoming so ubiquitous, it&#39;s making them vulnerable and workers are pushing back. Finally, Senator Diane Feinstein from California is facing scrutiny for her age but constituents remain divided on if she should stay in office or step down.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
