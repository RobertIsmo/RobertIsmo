<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is going on in the world right now! In technology, Google is working on making major changes to their search engine to keep up with competitors also working with Artificial Intelligence. In the US, there&#39;s a campaign against transgender rights that has caught a lot of people by surprise. In Sudan, there are explosions happening throughout the capital and it is feared that a civil war could come soon. Across the pond in Ukraine, there&#39;s another conflict breaking out, this one with Europe over grain imports. In Boston the yearly Marathon recently happened with a memorable tribute to an official therapy dog of the race. There was also a case at Fox News with the US First Amendment being put on trial. Lastly, Kyiv put on an emotional Easter celebration in spite of the wars surrounding them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
