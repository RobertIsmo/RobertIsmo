<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. The US government is in the middle of a deal to raise the debt limit and cut spending. Hundreds of thousands of people have lost Medicaid coverage since pandemic protections expired and some businesses have been taking advantage of a tax credit that&#39;s become a magnet for fraud. On top of that, there appears to be a decline in support for Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine, as evidence suggests people are feeling uneasy about the casualties from the war. Meanwhile, inflation has been creeping up which is putting pressure on the Federal Reserve. In other news, people are surprised by the success of a novel about video games and Ashley Judd reflected on the past year of mourning the loss of her mother who died by suicide.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
