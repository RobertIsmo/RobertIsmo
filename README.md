<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is trying to create schism within the Republican party from his Capitol Hill basement. Representatives Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have both announced bids to be Speaker of the House, and Nancy Pelosi recently lost her bonus office. Joe Biden cancelled $9 billion in student loan debt, and there are new regulations for student loan repayments. In Haiti, police from Kenya are being sent to bring order to gang-ravaged areas. Charlotte Sena, a 9 year old who went missing recently, was found thanks to a lucky break and some good detective work. Donald J. Trump is also on trial just now for civil fraud in New York, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis moved some campaign staff to Iowa after receiving a $15 million cash infusion. Lastly, Trump announced a massive $45.5 million fund-raising haul that tripled that of DeSantis&#39;.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
