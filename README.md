<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot of conflict in the world this year, both between states and domestically. In Israel, a father told of the moment his wife and two children were taken away by gunmen in a border town. There have been airstrikes and ground fighting between Israelis and Palestinians as well, with Middle Eastern countries expressing support for Palestinians. In the US, House Republicans are working to unify under new leadership after the previous speaker stepped down. Russia has been pumping money into its military machine in response to sanctions, and in Ukraine there is an ongoing war with Moscow. Meanwhile, grizzlies are coming to Montana and other western areas, and extreme hot weather across the globe has created problems for schools. Lastly, this year saw notable women achieve success in economics and Nobel Prizes won.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
