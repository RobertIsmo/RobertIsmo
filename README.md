<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, the Republican Speaker in Congress has been elected after a long and contentious fight. In terms of health, there&#39;s a serious situation developing with a new drug on the streets made from an animal tranquilizer mixed with Fentanyl. Meanwhile over in Ukraine, they&#39;re working to build a kind of super grenade to use against tanks. And in Iran, there are people facing the death penalty for their role in protests against the government. On top of all that, ESPN is looking at how to cover NFL games after a player collapsed on the field during a game this week.</p>

<h3>In Speaker Fight’s Final Hours, Arm-Twisting, Flaring Tempers and Calls From Trump</h3>

<p>Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s slog to his post ended with a remarkably public show of intraparty strife that played out in a history-making overnight session.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Cy7mUt"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>From Gingrich to McCarthy, the Roots of Governance by Chaos</h3>

<p>Mr. Gingrich began the zero-sum politics that mutated into the brand of the Tea Party and Trump M.A.G.A. Republicans and that presaged the raucous speaker battle in the House.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ItbPvp"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Why McCarthy’s Slog to Speaker Could Mean Dysfunction Ahead in the House</h3>
<sub>By Emily Cochrane</sub>
<p>The top Republican already had to work with a tiny majority and an emboldened right flank. Concessions he made to win his speakership gave the rebels more tools to sow disarray.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3vNbnR8"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
