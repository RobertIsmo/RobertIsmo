<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a crisis in the Red Sea, where ships have been attacked and energy and shipping firms have had to begin rerouting tankers, adding delays and costs to journeys which are set to affect oil prices. In Yemen, the Houthi militia has gained clout with these ship attacks. In Gaza, there&#39;s a split between those wanting an end to the war and those who are pushing for a definitive Israeli victory - this divide has been most notable between younger and older generations, who have very different opinions on Biden&#39;s support of Israel. 

Meanwhile in Russia, prominent dissident Aleksei Navalny is missing after not showing up to a court hearing two weeks ago. And in Iceland there was recently a volcanic eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula which did not appear to affect any air travel. Lastly, New York is considering reparations for descendants of enslaved people - Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill that will look into what can be done.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
