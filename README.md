<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of chaos and unrest happening around the world right now. In Israel, people are protesting after the Prime Minister fired a minister who had taken a stand against overhauling the court system. In Ukraine, thousands of former prisoners are fighting and dying in battle, leading to recognition of their memory as a patriotic imperative in Russia. On Twitter, parts of its source code have been leaked online, so the company is trying to identify who was responsible and see if anyone else downloaded it. Elon Musk has valued Twitter at $20 billion and recently bought it for $44 billion. Sports-wise, Miami and San Diego State have made it to the final four of the basketball playoffs after coming from behind and making some furious finishes. And Apple has encountered rare dissent over a new product which is expected to be an augmented reality headset. Tragically, here in the US, a couple and their 14-year-old son were killed in a tornado. Also, Steve Cohen has gone all-in with money-losing investments towards the New York Mets baseball team in Queens, Long Island. Some hotels are no longer offering daily room cleanings due to the pandemic and its aftermath. In China, marriage rates are low due to the one-child policy - resulting in fewer brides available - and grooms now have to pay higher &#39;bride prices&#39; just to get married. Lastly there is an interesting festival taking place every winter in Italy where people massacre each other with oranges! Lastly, scientists recently retracted a study that showed a rare goblin shark washed up on a Greek beach after realizing it might have actually been just a plastic toy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
