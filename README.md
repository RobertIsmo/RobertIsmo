<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news developing around the world recently. In the United States, former President Donald Trump is facing multiple felony counts and is putting the justice system to the test of public credibility. Meanwhile, in Europe, Ukraine is launching one of the largest military operations in Europe since World War II in response to Russian probes. In Arizona, there is a plan to take water from the sea in Mexico and pipe it to Phoenix despite low water levels in the area. Additionally, José Manuel Villarejo Pérez, a former intelligence agent, was caught leaking secret documents concerning Spanish society and is now facing prison time. Finally, four missing children were recently found alive after 40 days in the Colombian jungle following a plane crash that killed three adults on board.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
