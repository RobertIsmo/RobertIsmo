<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, some news is encouraging and some is concerning. On the economic front, the outlook is looking sunnier than a year ago, though stock and bond markets have been rallying in anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts. On the political side, here in the U.S. Republicans and Democrats found common ground for passing an important defense bill, while at the same time they are pushing forward with a formal investigation into President Biden&#39;s actions, though no evidence of an offense has been found yet. Elsewhere in the world, Russian leader Putin was giving his first comments about Evan Gershkovich, an American reporter detained in Russia, while E.U. leaders finally agreed to open membership negotiations with Ukraine after much disagreement. In addition to this, people in California are learning about water rights after generations have gone unchallenged and Israel&#39;s Prime Minister Netanyahu put together a war cabinet of rivals in order to fight Hamas in their region.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
