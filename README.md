<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there have been flight delays and cancellations due to bad weather, and people are sharing false information related to recent natural disasters like heatwaves, floods and wildfires. Scientists are also exploring new ways to map war.

In Ukraine, they are trying to get F-16s from the West but it’s not easy; while in the US, a defamation case against Rudy Giuliani for trying to overturn the 2020 election is moving forward. Plus, a legal case that could decide if Donald Trump is a felon could start before Super Tuesday voting starts. 

Meanwhile, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been reflecting on how she changed since taking office and some Republican women have pivoted to birth control laws to distract from their anti-abortion stances. There’s also a book that came out about when Naomi Klein encountered her ‘doppelganger’ as a conspiracy theorist. Lastly, Philadelphia is having a public debate about a white sculptor that was handpicked to create a Harriet Tubman statue and a new report highlights the Native American boarding school system which tried to assimilate Native children.</p>

Students at the schools gave up their names, their labor and sometimes their lives.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3qXvm0D"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
