<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening around the world related to climate change. Recently, countries from all over the world agreed to move away from fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources. There are also changes in how electricity is produced in different areas as well. A new agreement was made at a climate summit calling for the phasing out of fossil fuels, but with few specifics on how to fund a shift to green energy. On another note, the Supreme Court will be hearing a challenge to abortion pill access and there is rising urgency around the Ukraine-Russia conflict. To top it off, Tesla has recalled two million vehicles due to software issues and Christmas tree farms are actually benefiting wildlife!</p>

<h3>Under Rules of War, ‘Proportionality’ in Gaza Is Not About Evening the Score</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
