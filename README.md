<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. In the US, the Supreme Court has revived Biden&#39;s immigration guidelines, setting priorities for which unauthorized immigrants should be detained. The court itself has also been dealing with significant cases this term after it underwent a conservative shift last year. At the same time, people are feeling the effects of a decision from last year to strike down Roe v. Wade. People are scrambling to adjust to the new legal landscape around abortion, and polls show that opinion is increasingly shifting towards legal abortion with potential political consequences for 2024. 

In international news, there have been reports of Yevgeny V. Prigozhin - who leads a private force - deriding Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine as being about enriching Russia&#39;s elite rather than defending national interests. On that front, Ukraine has been slowly making progress in its counteroffensive with western-trained brigades entering the fight. Meanwhile in Ukraine itself, there is a war-themed restaurant that celebrates the struggles in earlier wars finding success again. 

On the science front, a new study bolsters the claim that room-temperature superconductor exists and it was verified by a team of researchers from earlier this year that had faced doubts from other scientists. Also on an entirely different note is Barbie and her Dreamhouse living out the American Dream without Ken present on the deed! Lastly, some Americans have started to understand why people buy guns and how this can alter behavior through social scientists questioning this concept.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
