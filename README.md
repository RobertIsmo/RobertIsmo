<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Donald Trump has been indicted for illegally keeping documents related to nuclear programs and foreign attacks. There&#39;s a growing debate among Republican candidates about how to approach the upcoming election in relation to Trump. In Ukraine, officials are claiming some success in a counteroffensive against Russian occupiers. Over in the theater world, nonbinary performers made history at the Tony Awards. In Scotland, Former Leader Nicola Sturgeon has been arrested in a financial inquiry. India experienced its worst railway disaster in decades with hundreds of people reported dead. Also in the US, the Supreme Court is about to rule on race-conscious college admissions and an I-95 overpass collapsed in Philadelphia due to a tanker fire, making it harder for commuters. And finally, singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell made her return to the stage after over 20 years with a nearly 3-hour performance that showed off both her voice and wit!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
