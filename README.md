<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been pretty tumultuous in the world lately. In Ukraine, there&#39;s a stalemate between two sides that have both launched offensives. In the US, Republicans are trying to evade blame over a possible government shutdown, while many agencies have plans in place to weather the disruptions if it happens. Meanwhile, the House voted to strip the defense secretary of salary and Republicans debated without Trump. President Biden and former President Trump gave speeches in Michigan that previewed a possible 2024 presidential election. Beyonce has been on tour that rivals the Olympics in scale and power. Prosecutors are facing tighter definitions of corruption in cases like Senator Menendez&#39;s, while a judge denied Trump&#39;s request for recusal in an election case. And of course, Michael Gambon from Harry Potter has passed away at 82 years old. Finally, immigrants are creating new communities throughout New York City.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
