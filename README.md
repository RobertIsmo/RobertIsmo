<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of news articles about what is happening in the world right now. In Palestine, the Palestinian Authority is attempting to govern Gaza after the war. Qatar and Egypt have been negotiating for the release of Thai hostages. People in Gaza are trying to return home during a ceasefire. On Black Friday, discounts are offered online and retail workers have to work hard to make holiday shopping possible. There are also some great travel deals on offer. Some powerful players are preventing efforts to conserve dwindling groundwater and more Chinese migrants than ever before are crossing into the US from Mexico. In Ireland recently there were riots in Dublin which were condemned and Nikki Haley, the former ambassador to the UN, is being discussed as a potential threat to President Trump in an upcoming election. Lastly, in Argentina, a far-right populist just won the presidency and is promising to sweepingly change the economy there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
