<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there&#39;s been a lot of news in the US and around the world. Fox News has just announced it is replacing Tucker Carlson’s show with &#39;Fox News Tonight&#39;. The reason is because many people have found his racial and conservative views offensive. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has declared he is running for re-election and has won the full support of the Democratic Party despite questions about his age and approval ratings. In foreign news, China tried to limit the damage caused by their ambassador&#39;s remarks questioning ex-Soviet sovereignty that angered Europe. A few people in media have been fired due to scandals, such as Don Lemon from CNN and Jeff Shell from NBCUniversal. Lastly, the First Republic Bank lost $102 Billion in customer deposits and the NY Jets made a trade for Aaron Rodgers to try to turn them into a Super Bowl contender.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
