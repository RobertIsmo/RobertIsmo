<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the business world is in a bit of an upheaval. Bank stocks are taking a dive despite an attempted rescue of one large bank, and Silicon Valley Bank recently filed for bankruptcy. The Fed is also increasing regulations on lenders and decreasing liquidity, which is impacting buyers and investors. 

Globally, China&#39;s leader Xi Jinping is meeting with Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#39;s president to work on the war that is taking place in Ukraine. Slovakia promised to send fighter jets, while the U.S. struggles as they can&#39;t fly through Russian airspace. 

They&#39;re also doing some interesting research into the pandemic. It turns out it may have started with raccoon dogs at a market in Wuhan, though this was removed from an international database after people asked China about it. 

And luckily, California&#39;s drought might be coming to an end due to a wet winter season. But water woes remain, so we will have to see how that goes! 

Finally, March Madness has been pretty wild! No. 15 Princeton and No. 13 Furman pulled off huge upsets against their higher-ranked opponents, and No. 1 seed Purdue looks like it could be headed down a successful path in the men&#39;s tournament when they play on Friday.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
