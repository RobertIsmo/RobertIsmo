<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s been some troubling news lately. In New York, a suspect was arrested in the serial killings of women near Gilgo Beach - it turns out that there were nine women, a man and a toddler found dead in the area. There’s still some mystery surrounding what exactly happened. Meanwhile, in the US, House Republicans managed to pass a defense bill containing a ton of social policy provisions - such as limits on abortions and gender transition procedures - that are unlikely to make it through the Senate. On top of that, actors in both LA and NY have gone on strike to demand a better deal from major studios; unfortunately, this means their absence from movie premieres and festivals could affect movie theaters and the festival circuit. Last but not least, former Vice President Pence had an awkward moment when he visited Iowa recently to answer questions about the Capitol riots on January 6th. Finally, the current US President Biden is switching up his big-money operation ahead of 2024 with the help of a new super PAC called Future Forward.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software.
