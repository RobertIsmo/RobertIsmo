<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, in the United States, President Biden is facing the challenge of potentially visiting Israel during a time of war. In relation to this, The New York Times is mapping the attacks in Israel and Gaza. The news is also covering a sad story in Illinois where a six year old Muslim boy was attacked and since then his family has been mourning his loss. Judge have imposed a limited gag order on Trump related to an election case. Jordan is edging closer to victory with his bid for speakership but there are still some Republican holdouts. Additionally, Senator Robert Menendez&#39;s attempt to host a fund-raiser at an island resort was not successful due to numerous cancellations following his indictment. 

In China, over the last few decades they have placed much of their investments in the real estate market with unfortunate long-term consequences affecting their economy now. They have also recently funded a project in Nepal, which has created plenty of debt for Nepal and an expensive airport.

Regarding health news, scientists may have found an explanation for long Covid cases due to remnants from the coronavirus that would stifle serotonin production. This understanding has led to fear of lab leaks that are stalling studies that could prevent future pandemic viruses. 

For something more positive, The New York Times compiled 25 of the best restaurants in New Orleans to explore different types of cuisine like Creole, Cajun and Trinbagonian. Lastly, thousands of migrants that were separated from their families at the US border by Trump have reached a settlement that will allow them to live and work temporarily and possibly become citizens if they win asylum.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
