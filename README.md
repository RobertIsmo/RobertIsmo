<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a tumultuous year around the world. In Ukraine, Russian authorities have separated thousands of children from their parents as the country is at war. Israel has continued to fight with Hamas with no end in sight. In the US, we&#39;ve had a record-breaking warm winter and fears of what climate change looks like have been growing. Private equity firms buying hospitals have led to an increase in medical errors and deadlock over gun control. Additionally, there have been some pretty amazing images created in the arts this year-- worth checking out!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
