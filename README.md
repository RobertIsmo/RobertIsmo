<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, defense failures are being reported and it may change strategies related to Hamas and Gaza. Here in the US, President Biden&#39;s efforts to negotiate a new alignment in the Middle East are being put at risk due to recent violence between Hamas and Israel. Furthermore, there is an ongoing immigration debate in Texas where homes are being bought by undocumented immigrants, prompting Governor Greg Abbott to call for hearings. Elsewhere, New York Mayor Eric Adams took a trip to Latin American countries to try and dissuade migrants from coming, but it seems like his efforts have not been successful so far. Immigration is also an issue here in the US as the Justice Department has been jailing thousands of undocumented immigrants without charges, sometimes for months at a time, for use as witnesses in smuggling cases. Additionally, devastating earthquakes have recently taken place in Afghanistan with huge numbers of death tolls expected. All while one man was exonerated of rape after spending decades wrongfully convicted because his accuser changed her story. 

On top of all that, we also have employers potentially miscalculating strikes taking place across different industries including UPS, Hollywood studios and Detroit automakers. Additionally, the town where &#39;Stranger Things&#39; partially films here in the US is hoping for production to start again soon due to the strike taking place. Overseas, a catastrophic event has struck Ukraine as a missile strike has killed an entire sixth of one village with many people still buried under rubble and graveyards filling up rapidly. Lastly, Vladimir Putin has been letting others around him rattle nuclear sabers while simultaneously distancing himself from those threats, leaving us all wondering what the future will bring. And to top it off, there is still plenty of news stories being shared over fun stuff like the backstory behind Tupac&#39;s murder, Paris Fashion Week colors and same-sex relations among mammals.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
