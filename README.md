<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of political tension in the US right now regarding President Biden&#39;s support for Israel, especially in light of the growing civilian death toll in Gaza. In terms of technology, Sam Altman has been reinstated as OpenAI&#39;s chief executive after a tumultuous five-day period. Meanwhile, OpenAI&#39;s board had been divided and feuding for months, leading to Altman&#39;s ouster.

On the health front, many are discussing the inadequacy of long-term care insurance to protect older Americans and provide financial security.

With Thanksgiving just around the corner, travel is expected to be more popular than it has been in nearly 20 years as airfare and gas prices drop. Not to be outdone, Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day parade looks like it&#39;ll be just as spectacular as ever with the immense amounts of work put into testing balloons and ensuring safety on the streets. 

Finally, there are interesting developments in other fields such as artificial intelligence and aviation. Regarding AI, there are deep divisions among experts in the field right now, while Chinse-American relations might help Boeing sell more aircraft if they can finally deliver planes ordered years ago.</p>

<h3>Why Long-Term Care Insurance Falls Short for So Many</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
