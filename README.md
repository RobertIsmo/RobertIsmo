<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, in the US, President Biden is asking Republicans to work with him in order to build a stronger economy. During his State of the Union Addres, he spoke about fentanyl and accused the Republicans of threatening Social Security and Medicare. It looks like he&#39;ll be working towards bipartisanship despite the hecklers that followed.

In rural Ukraine, as fighting continues there&#39;s a mobile clinic trying to help restore medical services to villages once occupied by Russian forces. In Memphis, it&#39;s being revealed that officers used excessive physical force against Tyre Nichols leading to his death and one of them even texted a picture of him after the beating. 

On the sports front, LeBron James made history by breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#39;s N.B.A scoring record and continues to be a threat no matter how old he gets with his evolved game. 

In the magazine section, singer SZA is exploring success and what it means for her while bestselling novelist Walter Mosley believes that America is getting dumber due to some people not having basic writing or thinking skills. 

Finally in terms of health news, there&#39;s been a murder charge for Lindsay Clancy; accused of strangling her three children and investigators looking into an avian influenza outbreak on mink farms which has highlighted the need for better surveillance going forward.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
