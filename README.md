<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the world experienced the passing of Benedict XVI, the first modern pope to resign from his position in 600 years. His death has caused an unprecedented moment for the Roman Catholic Church, with a living pope presiding over his funeral. People around the globe have responded to the news with mixed emotions, with Germany particularly affected given Benedict was the first German pope in 400 years.

Meanwhile, new political figures such as Elise Stefanik have been gaining traction while their attempts to rise through Trump-era politics are being heavily scrutinized by media. Additionally, polls used leading up to recent elections have caused some candidates to make bad decisions regarding their spending and strategies.

Elsewhere in the world, relations between Russia and Ukraine remain tense following devastating strikes made by Russian forces in Ukraine on New Year&#39;s Eve. To rally his allies and his own people, Ukrainian president Zelensky gave multiple speeches on the matter. In response to these attacks, many Kyiv residents have expressed anger and shock over their government&#39;s inability to protect them from further harm.

At home here in the U.S., teen pregnancies have dropped significantly due to better access to contraception and reduced child poverty rates are leading to a profound change of opportunity offered between generations. Additionally, close attention is currently being paid to companies such as Google, Apple and Meta who offer near-limitless digital basements for people to store important documents. Finally, there&#39;s some curiosity over the current state of midnight kissing and whether or not people are still eager to partake in this classic New Year&#39;s Eve tradition.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
