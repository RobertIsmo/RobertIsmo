<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! The US Justice Department has appointed Robert K. Hur, a special counsel to investigate the handling of classified documents associated with President Biden. They&#39;re also looking into what happened during the Trump presidency with Russia. In international news, there have been reports that Western tanks may be headed to Ukraine, which breaks an important taboo. The US economy is slowing down and inflation has moderated to 6.5 percent in December, which is good news for consumers and the Federal Reserve. On the political side, G.O.P leaders are standing by Santos as New York Republicans attempt to push him to resign from his post. In terms of travel, there are 52 places to visit in 2023 if you want to get out of your home country and explore the world. Microsoft has made a major move in A.I technology by investing in OpenAI, the creator of a chatbot that can do incredibly amazing things with conversations. Meanwhile, Lisa Marie Presley - daughter of Elvis Presley - died at 54 after a brief hospitalization. And finally, there&#39;s this really cool rock show happening in Ann Arbor where almost everyone attending is over 65-years-of-age called Geezer Happy Hour! And if all of this wasn&#39;t enough, Mayor Eric Adams just unveiled a $103 Billion budget for New York City as they face major challenges in trying to recover their economy from the pandemic aftermath.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
