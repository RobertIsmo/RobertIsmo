<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the business realm, young people are struggling to make ends meet and it appears to be affecting how they will vote in 2024. The Federal Reserve is also influencing how this election cycles outcome could look. Internationally, Israel&#39;s government is coming under fire with new reports of hostages found near one of their military hospitals. Closer to home, a prominent Congressman is introducing legislation to possibly expel Santos from his seat. In other politics news, an election for Speaker revealed some controversial views. Meanwhile, an American family in Gaza was forced to fight for survival amid war and turmoil in the country. For a more uplifting story, New York City is converting office spaces into homes for families who need them and universities are taking advantage of empty buildings too. Unfortunately, football players have been dying younger and younger due to CTE caused by hits made while playing sports early on. In the literary world, renown British novelist A.S. Byatt passed away at age 87 and a case by former singer Cassie against Sean Combs might change how we view her music career. Lastly, OpenAI&#39;s CEO has been removed and replaced with a new interim CEO following company changes.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
