<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are pretty chaotic in the world right now. Prosecutors have told Donald Trump&#39;s legal team that he is a target in an investigation, and there have been cross-border skirmishes between Ukraine and Russia leading to anxiety for villagers on both sides. Here in the US, Republicans are facing some in-fighting with the House being paralyzed by rebel members of the Freedom Caucus while members of Congress have gone back and forth on the FBI Director and contempt charges. On top of all that, we’re looking at a trillion dollar borrowing binge as the government approaches the debt limit, and some people fear there may be no room on cable news for independent journalism anymore. Finally, politicians are facing some tough questions too. There’s a longshot presidential hopeful in North Dakota and Florida&#39;s Governor Ron DeSantis making headlines with migrant flights to California, raising questions about the future of conservatism.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
