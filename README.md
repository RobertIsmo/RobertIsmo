<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The U.A.W. is poised to stage a partial strike against Detroit automakers this Friday, with union president Shawn Fain ruling out a contract extension for further negotiations. This could test President Biden&#39;s commitment to creating well-paying jobs through electric vehicles. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, a fugitive has finally been captured, ending a two-week manhunt. The Supreme Court has declared the DACA program—which has allowed thousands of young immigrants to remain legally in the states—illegal. Utah&#39;s Republican senator and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney has announced his retirement, urging for a &quot;new generation&quot; of leadership beyond President Trump and Joe Biden. Republican House Speaker McCarthy recently reversed his stance of needing a vote for an impeachment inquiry due to pressure from the right wing of the party. Ex-Hillary Clinton supporter Peter Daou is now running Cornel West&#39;s third-party campaign against the two-party system, while Vivek Ramaswamy has admitted his intention to fire most of the federal workforce if elected. Libya was recently hit by devastating floods that left many dead and missing and spotlighted how climate change can have swift and destructive consequences. Furthering international issues, Russian President Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently heralded their solidarity in a summit signalling new ties between their countries, possibly signalling more arms from North Korea towards Russia for its war in Ukraine. Finally, Evan Gershkovich&#39;s family are appealing to the United Nations for help in securing his release; Gershkovich is a reported for the Wall Street Journal who has been detained since June 2020 in Russia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
