<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been several protests and demonstrations around the world recently. In Brazil, rioters attacked the country&#39;s Congress, Presidential offices, and Supreme Court. In the US, a memorial wall for American service members who died in the Korean War was found to have many errors. Republicans in the US are also introducing new rules, while a case involving free speech and unauthorized immigration is pending in the Supreme Court. Also, restricted by COVID-19 restrictions, renowned restaurant Noma in Copenhagen announced it will close its doors. Israel is also in political turmoil with Ultra-Orthodox parties on the rise. Natural disasters are also wreaking havoc around certain regions of California as well as western New York. In comparison, Rome is trying to boost tourism with an outdoor skatepark with a view of the Colosseum. Lastly, a reminder that one&#39;s job is important but not all-important in trying times.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
