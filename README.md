<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, regulators have taken over a big bank and sold it to JPMorgan Chase. As part of the deal, 84 branches will be re-opened. Also, the government is relaxing rules on drug use as competition for talent increases. On the other hand, Iran executed a former senior official who had provided intelligence to Britain regarding Iranian nuclear and military programs. 

Pope Francis recently revealed he was working on a &#39;mission&#39; of peace in Ukraine, while in San Francisco, a Whole Foods Market is reflecting the city&#39;s woes with fewer tech workers spending money in the area. Meanwhile, an elite New York school has admitted to falling &#39;tragically short&#39; after a student&#39;s suicide, and Governor Hochul severed ties with her top political adviser due to backlash from an article The New York Times published. Lastly, Sudan is facing collapse of its health care system as hospitals close down and doctors flee.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
