<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In India, Modi allies are trying to expell the former Indian Prime Minister, Rahul Gandhi, from parliament through their legal system. In the US, there is an ongoing investigation into a drone strike that killed an american in Syria which revealed that defensive air systems weren&#39;t fully operational before it happened. At the same time, Republicans are demanding information from Manhattan district attorney in regards to a hush money inquiry for Trump and Trump himself is warning of possible violence if he&#39;s charged with anything. 

On a different note, there&#39;s talk of having Russia pay for Ukraine&#39;s rebuilding due to their war and aggression against them and in Montana, there is a landmark case against the state where 16 young people are suing the state claiming its support of fossil fuels violates the state Constitution. Another interesting story involves Marina Ovsyannikova who used to work in Russian state TV until she stormed a live broadcast one day telling viewers they were being lied to after Ukraine was invaded.

Lastly in terms of sports news, NJ is leaving a mark on this years NCAA men&#39;s basketball tournament with Princeton and Fairleigh Dickinson pulling off upsets as well as some standout performances by players. There is also Houston who had a basketball sensation nicknamed Phi Slama Jama in 1982-83 but eventually lost in the championship game to North Carolina State at the very last moments of it too. 

Things aren&#39;t completely negative though, You also have Do Kwon whose crypto company failed but is still managing to live a public life on the run since hes wanted for charges in South Korea and The US!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
