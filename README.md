<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In Ukraine, war is continuing, with small, hidden land mines posing a serious threat to counteroffensives. In the United States, the Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, is struggling to get his presidential campaign going as he faces competition from former President Donald J. Trump. Meanwhile, a long-shot candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has raised questions about antisemitism with his comments on Covid-19. In Britain, their cherished National Health Service (NHS) is in the worst crisis of its 75-year history, and in Canada Chinese state interference is targeting Canadian politicians who criticize Beijing. Finally, troubling design choices may have been what ultimately doomed the submersible, Titan.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
