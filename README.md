<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening in the world at the moment. In Morocco, people are still reeling from an earthquake and there’s been a slow response in providing aid to those stranded. Here in the US, new Covid-19 booster shots have been approved by the FDA and conspiracy theorists are making people more afraid than they need to be. Kim Jong-Un of North Korea is also making headlines. He&#39;s traveling to Russia to meet with President Putin and is asking for advanced technology and food aid. Meanwhile, China is spreading disinformation about Hawaii fires using artificial intelligence and there’s a debate in Britain over its relations with Beijing after the arrest of a suspected spy. Finally closer to home, Glenn Youngkin is trying to get Republicans a majority in state government during this year’s legislative races in Virginia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
