<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The US military is facing problems with nine of their newest ships and Congress is now involved in trying to save jobs. China was involved in an aerial crisis when a US fighter jet downed one of their spy balloons off the coast of South Carolina. China doesn&#39;t have many options for retaliation, but Beijing has expressed &quot;strong discontent and protest.&quot; This incident comes shortly after Pervez Musharraf, the former military ruler of Pakistan, passed away at 79 years old. Ukrainians have flocked to ski resorts to get relief from war in their Carpathian Mountains, while Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine is currently under a fierce battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Meanwhile, China is still dealing with the aftermath of their pandemic and memorializing many top academics who have passed away in the midst of it all. In Israel, there has been an increased surge of violence between settlers and Palestinians which raises fears of further escalation. The Koch Network is now looking to &quot;turn the page&quot; on Trump by providing a Republican alternative during the upcoming primaries. Lastly, the Inflation Reduction Act will help consumers save money while also fighting climate change when they make certain purchases such as electric cars or home appliances.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
