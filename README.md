<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is in the middle of a &#39;Tripledemic&#39;, where hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses are at an unusually high level, which makes it difficult to predict how bad this winter may be. In other news, Donald Trump sparked some controversy when it was revealed he left classified documents lying around high-traffic areas at his Mar-a-Lago estate. Elon Musk has also come under fire after he banned several high-profile journalists from his Twitter account, while simultaneously praised by some Silicon Valley bosses for his ruthless management style.

The world is also tackling climate change and biodiversity conservation with crucial talks being held in Canada to try and protect wildlife from declines. Unfortunately, animals are running out of places to live as habitats have shrunk drastically. Also, comparisons can be drawn between Mexico&#39;s World Cup concert which was sold out months before but only saw a half empty floor on the night and private equity firms that are coming into the child care industry. 

Finally, there have been some lighter moments too with Joe Lycett using comedy to gently protest Qatar&#39;s L.G.B.T.Q laws, and those dealing with grief having the chance to turn their holiday traditions into a positive experience over time.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
