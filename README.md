<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like global diplomacy is changing – a Chinese-brokered deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran upended Mideast diplomacy and pushed Washington to the sidelines. The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, wants to offer an alternative to the US-led world order. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis has been accused of politicizing the removal of if elected prosecutor in order to serve his own political interests, which has caused some controversy. 

In terms of environmental issues, the Biden Administration is expected to move ahead with an $8 billion drilling project in a large part of pristine wilderness in the US. Meanwhile in Ukraine there&#39;s both a literal and figurative battle taking place. Farmers who till the land are exposed to risk from landmines and cluster bombs – making it hard for them to reap a normal harvest – and there&#39;s also a fight for control over Bakhmut with Russian forces seeking advances in the east. </p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
