<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there was an epic battle between tanks, with Russian forces sustaining a major setback. In Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot was defeated in her bid for re-election, and Paul Vallas is now the frontrunner in the April runoff. In Greece, a train crash has killed at least 36 people and shattered two of the carriages. In Nigeria, political &quot;Godfather&quot; Bola Tinubu sought the presidency and campaigned to address security and economic issues. Eli Lilly has announced plans to lower the monthly cost of insulin down to $35. An Israeli raid on a safe house has ended with deaths of civilians, and in South Carolina jurors have visited the crime scene for a murder trial. At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference this week, former President Donald Trump will attend but many possible 2024 rivals are skipping it. Finally, some young adults who returned home due to COVID-19 are trying to figure out when they can return to independent living.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
