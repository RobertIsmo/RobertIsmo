<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a devastating earthquake recently in Turkey and Syria. Meanwhile, the US is stepping up its efforts to restrict Chinese citizens and companies from purchasing land. Tensions between US and China are also rising due to incidents involving balloons, which were initially dismissed as unexplained phenomena. Back in the US, Joe Biden is preparing to deliver his first State of the Union address since they GOP took over the House - he&#39;ll focus on raising taxes on the wealthy and providing more social aid to those in need. On the technology front, A.I.-generated personas are being used for a state-aligned information campaign – exploring new ways of spreading disinformation and toxic content.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
