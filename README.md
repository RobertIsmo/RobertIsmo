<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there are a lot of tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. Iran and Hezbollah have been accused of playing a role in organizing an attack on Israel. In response, people in Israel have come together to volunteer and donate supplies for those affected. Meanwhile in the US, there is a lot going on as well. There are airstrikes in Gaza, political turmoil over a Republican House Speaker candidate, and scrutiny of Chinese Bitcoin mines near US data centers and nuclear bases. President Biden has recently shown support for Israel, which has caused some controversy due to it being divided from Palestine. Florida Governor DeSantis has also been facing questions about his stance on Palestine while out on the campaign trail. Lastly, there is an extreme shortage of food cart permits in New York City with 10,000 vendors yet to receive one despite recent reforms made by the city.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
