<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot of tension and conflict in the Middle East, with the FBI warning that it has the potential to spark terrorist attacks against the US. In reaction to this, Congress is considering aid legislation that could also help Ukraine, but politicians are divided on how much support to give. 

At home, firearms laws are being debated after a mass shooting in Maine. There&#39;s been a ban on mobile phones in one Florida school district, which seems to have had positive effects on student engagement. Meanwhile a crypto exchange CEO stands accused of fraud, and there&#39;s controversy over whether bariatric surgery should be used to treat childhood obesity. 

There&#39;s also some sweet news - candy corn is finally getting its due respect! The UAW strike is gaining momentum with potential to set precedent when negotiating contracts and union rights in other industries. Upstate New York orchards are struggling due to excessive rains eight weekends in a row. 

Lastly, two opinion pieces on the Middle East and addiction both touch hearts - looking at false claims leading up to Iraq War, as well as Matthew Perry&#39;s honesty about his battle with addiction.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
