<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is increasing concern about the influence of Chinese censorship on stories about Covid-19. It has caused some scientific studies to be retracted and data to be withheld or deleted, which makes it hard to learn more about the virus. In Sudan, two warring generals have led to an exodus of diplomats and other foreigners from the strategically important country. Meanwhile in the US, the University of Virginia has come under attack from alumni over a plan for “more diversity, less Confederacy”. In Ukraine, Russian troops are forcibly relocating civilians near the southern city of Kherson due to escalating violence there. On immigration issues, US President Biden has used his executive authority to significantly expand the number of legal immigrants entering the US. In Scotland, a 25 acre island is up for sale but comes with no amenities and reaching it takes significant effort. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond has recently filed for bankruptcy due to its failure to adjust to the changing retail market and an expensive lobbying war over banning menthol cigarettes is happening in New York among Black leaders. Jeff Shell has stepped down as CEO of NBCUniversal after an inquiry into an inappropriate relationship with a woman within the company and Rachel Weisz&#39;s streaming remake of “Dead Ringers” brings a new perspective on childbirth. Finally, a garden designer offers advice on how to create a successful container garden.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
