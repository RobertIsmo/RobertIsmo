<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a turbulent time in the world lately. In Russia, troops have uncovered a depressing sight as they advance in a counteroffensive - dirty socks, rotting bodies, and other detritus left behind by abandoning enemy forces. In Norway, the war in Ukraine is threatening livelihoods in the Arctic Circle by disrupting cross-border trade that had been a mainstay up there. NATO has played an important role in attempting to push back against Russian aggression since Ukraine is not a member of NATO. 

Meanwhile, there&#39;s some really weird weather patterns happening as a result of climate change here in the US - heat beneath the ground is causing parts of Chicago to sink, and Southern California is experiencing landslides which are taking out hillsides and houses. Japan&#39;s been hit with torrential rain leading to devastating floods and landslides, and back here in America students&#39; academic progress has stalled for the past school year despite billions of dollars of federal aid. 

In Israel, people are protesting government plans to curb judicial power evidenced by large scale demonstrations and disruption throughout the country. And lastly, former president Trump&#39;s lawyers are pushing for an indefinite postponement of his documents trial before Judge Aileen M. Cannon makes her decision on all motions at hand.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
