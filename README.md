<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of tension surrounding European unity and Ukraine, as a big election in Slovakia could determine Ukraine&#39;s future alliances. The vote is a test of Russia&#39;s efforts to undermine European unity. In China, their economic slowdown is posing one of the biggest challenges for President Xi Jinping since he was appointed.

In the US, there&#39;s new restrictions on abortion and medical leaves that are making it harder for obstetricians to practice across red states. On the other side, student mental health policies at Yale are improving in response to student activism.

In sports, tennis pros are turning to drop shots to win matches and American Ben Shelton made the semifinal in the US Open. Meanwhile, Chinese player Zheng Qinwen has been progressing well through her matches at the same tournament. Lastly, in tech news, one of the founders of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX is under legal charges and being kept in jail with bread, water and peanut butter. Lastly, Republicans in Wisconsin are trying to impeach a liberal State Supreme Court justice before she&#39;s been able to hear any cases.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
