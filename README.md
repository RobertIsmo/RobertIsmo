<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! The U.S. is working to free an American journalist held by Russia on bogus espionage charges. The Pope is trying to mediate peace negotiations in Ukraine, but it doesn&#39;t look to be making much progress. There was a shooting in an Atlanta medical building that left one dead and four injured, and police are searching for a suspect. In addition, US history scores for 8th graders have been declining for almost ten years. And lastly, Fox News host Tucker Carlson was fired based on a text message he sent about white men fighting differently than others.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
