<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;m catching up on a lot of news lately. Here&#39;s the short version: Russia is in a standoff with one of its leaders and 19 people, including former President Donald J. Trump, have been charged with an election inquiry in Georgia. It looks like Rudy Giuliani may turn himself into authorities soon in an election case that he was involved in last year. Meanwhile, the federal minimum wage is becoming obsolete due to a hot job market, and revisions to data have slightly decreased the reported U.S. job growth for the past year. There&#39;s also some fascinating developments with A.I. helping a paralyzed woman regain her speech after losing it due to a stroke. Finally, India has successfully completed a mission to reach the lunar south pole—the first nation to do so—and there&#39;s an ongoing inheritance case involving the Wildenstein art dynasty.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
