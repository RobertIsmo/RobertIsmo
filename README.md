<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, a group of 9&#x2F;11 relatives are calling out the PGA tour&#39;s potential merger with LIV as a &quot;betrayal.&quot; Tensions in Ukraine continue to escalate as a destroyed dam has caused flooding in several villages. In the US, Chris Christie has announced his official bid for the 2024 presidential run. At the same time, Donald Trump is part of an inquiry by a Florida grand jury concerning unknown complexities. And while environmentalists are concerned over a sharp decline in American kestrels numbers, South Park creators have re-opened an old canteen with better food. There is also an ongoing case about journalistic investigations on misconduct in New Hampshire, which have sparked attacks against journalists with legal ramifications for First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
