<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of news across the world related to issues around disinformation, social media networks, and government control. In the U.S., a judge is ruling on a case that could redefine how the government responds to false claims and disinformation. In Israel, authorities just finished a major raid in the West Bank. Meanwhile, Biden is trying to get Sweden to join NATO, and Florida governor DeSantis is trying to make a strong case against Trump in terms of his campaigning. In Ukraine, they&#39;ve recently launched airstrikes against a Russian-occupied city. Instagram released a new app called Threads which many are speculating will compete with Twitter. China has been taking people&#39;s spouses as part of its surveillance state - one woman recently discovered her husband was a secret dissident blogger. Across the country over the past weekend, there have been shootings in multiple cities, including Louisiana where four people were killed. Lastly, at the local level, Yusef Salaam-one of the Central Park Five who were wrongfully convicted-was declared winner in an NYC City Council Primary race.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
