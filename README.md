<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there are reports of funding woes for the IRS, and the possibility for many areas to have white Christmases this year. At the same time, investigators have been able to pinpoint a Russian military unit behind a serious atrocity in Ukraine, and Ukraine&#39;s president made a pitch for support in Washington. On the European front, one snack shop is still managing to serve people despite ongoing shelling in a city located in a key battleground of the war. Back at home, a disgraced cryptocurrency executive has been released on bail and SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said existing rules surrounding cryptocurrency are adequate but warned companies to stay compliant. Politically, the US Senate has managed to pass a $1.7 trillion spending bill amidst worries of an impending government shutdown, while members of Congress recently updated the Electoral Count Act after recognizing it could be abused during presidential elections. Additionally, not too far from us here in New York, an intriguing mystery has arisen involving an area doctor who disappeared mysteriously from his boat.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
