<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some pretty interesting stories making news all over the world. In Israel, tragedy recently struck as Hamas launched a series of attacks in the town of Be’eri. Meanwhile, Russia appears to have indicated an interest in seeking a ceasefire to end the conflict in Ukraine. In Yemen, the U.S. is dealing with a special challenge presented by the Houthi militia launching attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. 

Closer to home, Trump&#39;s legal woes and eligibility for office have been in spotlight recently. Meanwhile, a slow rollout of a national charging system for electric vehicles may hinder adoption, while Hallmark and Lifetime holiday movies have been analyzed to figure out just how formulaic they are. Democrats running for Senate and House seats in key states have expressed concerns that Biden has not done enough to excite voters ahead of this year&#39;s election. Biden&#39;s appeal to Black voters will be tested in South Carolina and paramedics were recently found guilty in regards to the death of Elijah McClain. 
Last but not least, truck drivers across Japan and America are facing difficulties related to finding parking for their vehicles - a major headache for many long-haul truckers.</p>

<h3>Any Other Politician Would Have Bowed Out. Trump? Not a Chance.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
