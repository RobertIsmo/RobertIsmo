<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news recently that affects the US. Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden&#39;s son, was charged with evading taxes on millions of dollars he made from foreign companies. Congress is currently investigating some Ivy League universities such as Harvard, M.I.T and University of Pennsylvania for how they are handling antisemitism on campus. Some donors have started withdrawing donations and calls are growing for the university presidents to resign. Also, a professor at East Carolina University killed three faculty members at UNLV. 

Internationally, Iran is using proxies to escalate tension with Israel by sending missiles and drones towards Israeli and American targets. We&#39;re also learning about how forests can fight climate change thanks to a new NASA program that uses sensors in space to measure the amount of carbon-storing protected areas there are. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
