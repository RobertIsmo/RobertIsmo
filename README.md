<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Trump is crushing his competition in the G.O.P primary and people are waving away concerns about his legal issues. Meanwhile, the Phoenix area has gone through an intense stretch of over 110-degree-days and it&#39;s starting to take its toll economically. Over in Russia, there&#39;s a spending-boom causing bubble fears and over in Ukraine, Saudi Arabia is trying to help broker peace talks. Myanmar is still continuing their campaign of terror against citizens after a coup and in soccer, more support systems are emerging for female soccer players but there are still plenty of gaps and discrepancies between men&#39;s and women&#39;s play. Finally, it looks like the US FBI has been using a mysterious spy tool with potentially questionable contracts that have recently been canceled.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
