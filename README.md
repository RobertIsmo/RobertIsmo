<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now! In Israel and Ukraine there are ongoing wars, and President Biden recently spoke about the stakes democracy is facing in those conflicts. Desperate people in Gaza are waiting for relief aid to arrive, but it is being held up by diplomatic issues. In the US, there are also political issues, such as Republican lawmakers fighting over who will be speaker of the House. Meanwhile, Donald Trump recently claimed he was immune from certain prosecution but that claim was denied by federal prosecutors. And to top it all off, Britney Spears released her memoir recently which chronicles her rise to fame and struggles with paparazzi culture. Finally, T Magazine has released their 2023 Greats issue which celebrates four influential figures across music, film, art and fashion.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
