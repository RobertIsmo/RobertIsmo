<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, four members of the far-right extremist group Proud Boys were convicted of sedition after storming the Capitol on Jan 6th. Meanwhile, in Russia two explosions occurred in Moscow in what may have been a drone attack and both Ukraine and Russia have angrily blamed each other for it. 

China has recently reopened but foreign businesses are concerned that the communist party&#39;s focus on control and censorship might be behind some of their questioning. In addition, censorship has been scrubbed from the internet to prevent discussion of poverty. 

In Montana, a single extended family has spearheaded its unflinching conservatism, having three members hold leadership positions in the legislature. Small banks such as PacWest and Western Alliance have been forced to take steps to reassure investors as their shares have dropped significantly. Goldman Sachs is being investigated for their work with Silicon Valley Bank which ended with SVB collapsing after making a disastrous move. 

Elsewhere, Supreme Court Justice Thomas&#39; friend has defended him over his failure to disclose tuition payments received from Harlan Crow and Ed Sheeran was victorious in a copyright case against Marvin Gaye&#39;s classic &#39;Let&#39;s Get It On&#39;. Lastly, Tucker Carlson&#39;s latest book reveals insight into his white racial ideology.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
