<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There&#39;s been a lot of news about the Middle East, particularly in regards to the conflict between Israel and Gaza. There have been huge protests around the world, particularly in NYC in support of Palestine. Technology news has been dominated by a shakeup at OpenAI, a tech company, and there&#39;s concern about increasing antisemitism online. In other news, a US judge ruled that former President Donald Trump had engaged in insurrection and there are investigations into colleges for dealing with complaints of antisemitism and Islamophobia. Finally, there&#39;s been controversy over a sideline reporter making up reports during an NFL game.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
