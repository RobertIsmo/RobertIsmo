<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some big developments in the world recently. In the US, some medical schools are using a new tool—adversity scores—to try to create a more diverse class of students. The Supreme Court has also ruled on affirmative action, sparking a lot of conversation about its implications for the legacy of slavery in America.

In Eastern Europe, Ukraine is battling Russia in their conflict—it&#39;s been a brutal and grueling fight but protests have been taking place against it. Experts in Russia and Ukraine have been discussing Putin&#39;s invasion and weighing its impacts in several recent books. Meanwhile, Russia conducted a drone attack on Kyiv overnight.

In Michigan, there have been efforts to accelerate climate change initiatives despite their lag behind other states due to long-term resistance from lawmakers. In France, racial divisions are being highlighted as a police killing occurred at the same time that a ban on headscarves in soccer was announced. Protests have broken out across the country as 700 people were arrested during the fifth night of unrest.

On an industrial level, carmakers are being forced to go into the mining business to ensure they don&#39;t suffer from shortages of raw materials needed for electric vehicles. Last but not least, Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel is slowly but determinedly back in competition after taking a break for mental health reasons.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
