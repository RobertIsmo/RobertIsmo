<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news about America right now. A New York Times investigation has revealed that near misses involving U.S. commercial airlines happen multiple times a week. California is also drought-free for the first time in 3 years due to heavy rain and snow, and Hawaii has experienced devastating wildfires, leading President Biden to visit Maui to survey the damage. Democrats are now feeling more optimistic about 2024, and Iowa poll results suggest a remarkably stable G.O.P race ahead of the caucuses. Finally, President Trump and his advisers are debating whether or not he should take part in upcoming debates with President Biden, with the RNC possibly being involved in that decision.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
