<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some devastating events around the world recently. In Hawaii, there was a ferocious fire that killed 106 people and families are still recovering from the tragedy. In New York State, former president Trump is facing legal repercussions for spreading lies surrounding the 2020 presidential election, while Rudy Giuliani has been indicted in a Georgia election conspiracy case. Meanwhile, start-ups and investors are desperately trying to obtain chips used to power Artificial Intelligence products and hackers have been exploring potential vulnerabilities with the White House and A.I. companies&#39; blessing. Finally, there is a Romanian route which provides a lifeline allowing Ukrainian grain to reach the sea under a NATO umbrella while Russia threatens ships in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
