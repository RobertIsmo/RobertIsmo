<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the Republican party nominated Mike Johnson for Speaker in an unexpected move after passing over his predecessor Emmer. A report came out from US intelligence agencies that they have a high confidence that a hospital explosion was caused by a Palestinian rocket. Yocheved Lifshitz, an 85 year old Israeli peace activist, was kidnapped and beaten for 17 days by Hamas while in subterranean captivity in Gaza. Michael Cohen has accused Donald Trump of manipulating his net worth at a federal courtroom. Three lawyers, including Trump, were charged with attempting to overturn the 2020 election results and now they are cooperating with prosecutors in a racketeering case. In Canada, due to wildfires 45 million acres have been burned this year and evacuations have been necessary. Young people in Ukraine are having to deal with the war, including frontline service and evacuating children from villages near the front line. Richard Roundtree has passed away at 81 after being made famous for his role in Shaft, but he had continued to act afterwards as well. An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot admitted to taking psychedelic mushrooms while disrupting a flight and said he thought he was experiencing a nervous breakdown. Microsoft&#39;s A.I investment is stabilizing their Cloud business, as revenue has increased 13% compared to a year ago while profit has risen 27%.</p>
