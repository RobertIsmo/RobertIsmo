<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world seem to be a bit chaotic right now. Putin is looking to increase his influence in Africa, and the Central African Republic is facing a lot of conflict with little Western reaction. Here in the US, we&#39;re contending with extreme cold weather and power outages, particularly in Canada where thousands are without power due to the storms. On a more positive note, despite fears for democracy and extremist Republican candidates, an important demographic managed to swing an election in the right direction. Arizona judge has also rejected an election loss by Kari Lake on false election claims. On a lighter note, we have some older people as successful in their jobs as Tom Brady and a game show dedicated to people over 50 who are single. In Afghanistan, there&#39;s an effort to bar women from NGOs causing further unrest. Back at home there&#39;s a congressional investigation into the events of January 6th and all around us there are holiday movies getting more and more outlandish every year.</p>

<h3>Putin Wants Fealty, and He’s Found It in Africa</h3>
<sub>By Roger Cohen and Mauricio Lima</sub>

<h3>In Buffalo, it was ‘a very, very bad night in our community.’</h3>
<sub>By Michael D. Regan and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura</sub>
<p>A barreling storm thrust piles of snow against the fronts of homes and businesses, pinning vehicles parked in roads and driveways. The few people who ventured out faced bitterly cold temperatures.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3WoJwSX"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Storm Batters Canada, Leaving Thousands Without Power</h3>

<h3>How the Worst Fears for Democracy Were Averted in 2022</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
