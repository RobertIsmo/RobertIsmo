<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of tension in the world right now. In the US, there has been a lot of worrying news lately: A gunman caused chaos on a college campus in Michigan and there have been planes shooting down mysterious objects from the sky. At the same time, Republicans are facing internal divisions that are making it hard for them to pass legislation.

In Syria, a huge earthquake has devastated the northwest region of the country, but very little international aid has been sent there due to it being controlled by opposition forces. The Syrian president recently agreed to open two border crossings in order to get aid to the people who need it.

Meanwhile, in Russia, an underground network is helping dissidents escape long prison sentences. But closer to home, Ukraine is blocking aid workers from entering one of its cities to deliver supplies as Moscow’s forces close in.

Finally, on the business side of things, tourism has helped push Japan back into economic growth after a period of recession. They also have a new leader for their central bank, who will have to make some tough decisions about financial policy going forward.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
