<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the U.S., there has been a major win for Attorney General Letitia James, who won a court ruling against former president Donald J. Trump, effectively deciding that he had committed fraud and should be stripped of control of key properties. In addition, both Senate Republicans and Democrats have reached a spending deal to prevent a government shutdown and provide billions in aid for Ukraine and disaster relief. On the business front, TV and movie writers have voted to end their 148-day strike as well as Las Vegas hospitality workers who have authorized a potential strike at major resorts. On the international scene, there was an unfortunate tragedy where more than 100 people were killed in a fire at a wedding hall in Iraq during the bride and groom&#39;s dance. There has also been an antitrust lawsuit filed against Amazon by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for allegedly using its monopoly power to stifle competition and raise prices. Lastly, on a lighter note, there have been some interesting developments showing the cross-over popularity of sports stars and musicians such as NFL star Travis Kelce who recently rubbed shoulders with pop star Taylor Swift.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
