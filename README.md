<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot happening in the world right now. The Supreme Court recently upheld a law that is aimed at keeping Native American adoptees within tribes, and Justice Neil Gorsuch has been a staunch defender of tribal rights. There are a lot of important Supreme Court decisions being made this term, including some on abortion, guns, religion, and climate change due to a new conservative majority. Meanwhile, President Trump is trying to “go after” Joe Biden with a new legal strategy, and his supporters held peaceful protests in Miami in response to his recent indictments. On top of that, a painting stolen decades ago recently resurfaced at a museum doorstep. In New Jersey, kids are now being taught problem-solving skills as part of an innovative curriculum centered around climate change. In Britain, reports suggest Boris Johnson misled Parliament about lockdown parties before resigning from office last week. On the international front, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have been displaying apparent camaraderie for each other. Finally, there&#39;s been pushback against the big corporatization of health care causing alienation among doctors in America - and in response to the White House&#39;s complaints about misleading ticket prices, ticket companies are now promising more transparency on fees for concerts and other events.</p>

<h3>In Miami, the Only Violence From Trump Supporters Was Rhetorical</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
