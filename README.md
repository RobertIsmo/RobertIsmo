<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seem to be a lot of political and military tensions around the world right now. In the US, right-wing House Republicans have derailed a Pentagon bill, leading to warnings of a government shutdown. In Ukraine, President Zelensky is trying to gain global support for his country in its fight with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Meanwhile in Iran, President Rouhani is threatening US officials from the UN podium. On a lighter note, Canada is trying to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia through some kind of security deal and Azerbaijan has started a military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Closer to home, there have some special elections in Pennsylvania resulting in Democrats maintaining control of the state’s lower chamber. Finally, Jann Wenner’s reign as head of the Rock Hall of Fame ended abruptly after he made racist and sexist remarks in an interview with The New York Times, and Temple University&#39;s very recently appointed acting president JoAnne A. Epps has passed away after becoming ill on stage.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
