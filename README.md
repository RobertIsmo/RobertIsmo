<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s been a lot of news lately! Last year, an investigation into Donald Trump was thought to be over, but it&#39;s been resurrected recently with an indictment. It seems like a pattern of salacious behavior has come back to haunt him. The power struggle around him has caused some Republicans to support him despite his controversial nature, but there&#39;s also growing fatigue from people in his party who are embarrassed by him. In other news, storms have caused considerable damage in the Midwest and South, killing at least 10 people and injuring many more. In foreign affairs, China is drawing lessons from Russia&#39;s experiences during the conflict in Ukraine, and espionage charges have been brought against an American reporter detained in Russia. Finally, Putin-aligned artists are shunning the West and strengthening cultural ties with Eastern countries like China. The FBI has also been investigating the Proud Boys after their involvement in January 6th events.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
