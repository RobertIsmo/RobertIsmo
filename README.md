<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some serious issues going on around the world. In the US, people are talking about child labor and migrant children living and working here. Around the world, there&#39;s been a lot of violence, especially in countries like Israel and Gaza. In California, electric trucks are being heavily pushed as a greener alternative. Meanwhile, public figures in the US are coming under fire for their comments about slavery and the Civil War. And of course, there&#39;s also great art and entertainment to be found too!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
