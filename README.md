<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is going through some major changes. In the US, five officers have been charged with murder in a police killing of a black man in Memphis, and in Nashville there&#39;s a rift between the city and state legislature as partisan divides become more evident. There&#39;s also been a scandal regarding Ukrainian corruption that has sparked concerns of foreign aid over here. Closer to home, a gunman attacked a dance studio in Monterey Park and we now know more details about the weapon he used. 

Meanwhile there are issues globally, too. The Colorado River is running dry which has seven states in an uproar over how to saddle the pain of reduced water usage, and the UK government is rejecting Scottish gender bills which could bolster independence movements. 

Overall, the news looks pretty bleak right now – but some small sources of light remain with inspiring stories like the farmworker who came face to face with the Half Moon Bay gunman but was spared or Joan Didion&#39;s papers being acquired by the New York Public Library!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
