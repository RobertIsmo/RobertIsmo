<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot of interesting things going on in the world right now. In Turkey, voters are heading to the polls for an important election that could decide the future of their country for years to come. The current president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is facing his toughest challenge yet. Meanwhile in Ukraine, the nation is fighting against Russian forces in the city of Bakhmut while their president seeks out help from Germany. Closer to home here in the US, politicians are gearing up for 2024 when political parties and presidential hopefuls prepare for a likely heated election cycle. We&#39;re also seeing how massive wealth transfers will reshape economic inequality in America, and a new Fort making history by renaming itself after a military couple.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
