<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on in the world recently. In Ukraine, a minister recently died in a helicopter crash, and in Israel the Supreme Court ordered the removal of a minister close to the Prime Minister. Closer to home, Microsoft is laying off 10,000 workers as they look to cut costs, and Representative George Santos has been seen with far-right politicians, signaling his move away from mainstream politics. There are also environmental considerations, as California is still in drought despite recent rainstorms and studies show that Black residents could be disproportionately affected by major floods. Finally, California and other states are suing drug companies and pharmacy benefit managers for raising insulin prices.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
