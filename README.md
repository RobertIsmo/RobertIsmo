<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot going on in the US, particularly with news surrounding Hunter Biden and his plea deal being put on hold by Judge Maryellen Noreika. In the UK, sanctions have been issued against Russia for their invasion of Ukraine but there has been ambiguity since some oligarchs have received generous exemptions. Tragically, Sinead O&#39;Connor, an evocative and outspoken singer from Ireland passed away at 56 years old. In regards to current education policies in the US, a ruling on affirmative action is shaking universities across the nation as there are questions about how race is considered. Additionally, Mitch McConnell suffered an episode at the Capitol when he froze midsentence and temporarily couldn&#39;t speak which has raised questions about his health and future. There are other inconveniences happening globally as well; there was a record-breaking 101°F ocean temperature off Florida and illegal border crossings near the Southern US border have dropped significantly due to a new asylum policy initiated by Biden&#39;s administration that was recently blocked by a judge. Lastly, in Niger there recently was a military coup after soldiers detained President Mohamed Bazoum who was known as one of the West’s most reliable partners in a volatile region.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
