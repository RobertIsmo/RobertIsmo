<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

<h3>Fentanyl Cuts a Bitter Swath Through Milwaukee</h3>

I&#39;ve got some news to share. There&#39;s been criminal charges leveled against Sam Bankman-Fried at the founder of FTX, and it looks like there are some connections to his parents who are faculty members at Stanford Law School. In other business news, with FTX gone, Binance is trying to jump into the void and be one of the biggest crypto exchanges around.

Turning to science, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory just had a major breakthrough involving lasers that could lead to new energy sources in the future. And over in Texas there has been a surge of migrant crossings on the border which have overwhelmed the area. 

Meanwhile, in a few places around the world, Iran has been using public executions for protesters and Russia&#39;s president Putin decided to skip his annual press conference for reasons possibly related to their war efforts. And in Norway, there&#39;s been a heightened level of paranoia because everybody is on alert for Russian spies. 

In sports news, Qatar hired a lot of retired players for their World Cup coverage and Croatia is one win away from its second straight World Cup final (which may go into extra time!). Lastly, Fentanyl is cutting through Milwaukee and it&#39;s especially affecting people of color - it sounds like this is one of the worst drugs that an experienced drug counselor has seen.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
