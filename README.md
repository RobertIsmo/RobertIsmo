<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 12, Central Standard Time</p>

There has been a lot of tension between Israel and Gaza recently. After numberous strikes by Israel, much of Gaza&#39;s neighborhoods have been destroyed. Many are having trouble understanding Israel&#39;s evacuation decrees, and it could be a life or death situation for some. They&#39;re also facing cyberattacks, partciularly in Ukraine - where people rely on phone alerts to warn them of impending Russian bombardments. Russia has suffered its own losses due to the war in Ukraine, and Finland has had to partly reopen its border with Russia as a result of migrants It&#39;s had other ripple effects in places like Harvard University, which faces criticism for antisemitism issues and consequent calls for its president to leave. College campuses have seen tension too, as well as infighting at Penn over questions of power and leadership. Regardless, consumer sentiment has improved due to lower gas prices.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
