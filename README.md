<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world to discuss. A leader of an online group that leaked classified documents related to the war in Ukraine has been identified as an Air National Guardsman. New leaked documents suggest that there was broad infighting among Russian officials which are now breached, likely containing more material than previously thought. The Justice Department is now seeking emergency Supreme Court action after a ruling that blocked the abortion pill mifepristone from being sent by mail. There is also discussion of an online market for unregulated abortion pills, though there is evidence that various abortions pills are safe. On a less serious note, there was recently a landmark trial against Fox News that could affect libel law and a VHS tape of the movie Rocky just sold for $27,500 due to a nostalgia boom. To top it all off, Mary Quant, who revolutionized British fashion in the 1960s, recently passed away and Donald Trump is now being questioned in the New York Attorney General&#39;s lawsuit. Lastly, Dan Snyder just agreed to sell the Washington Commanders for $6 billion.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
