<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there is chaos due to a mercenary army called Wagner that is playing an outsize role in Russia&#39;s campaign to take Bakhmut. Also, in Guam, abortion is legal but nearly impossible to get since there are no resident doctors who perform abortions. In New York City, celebrities are joining a fight to save a crumbling church from being replaced by condos. Jenna Lyons of J. Crew has joined the rebooted “Real Housewives of New York City” show. Schools in Newark are testing out automatic teaching aid from Khan Academy but the report card says it &quot;could use improvement.&quot; There&#39;s a plea deal with the accused shooter at Club Q in Colorado Springs which means they will spend a lifetime in prison for killing five people. John B Goodenough passed away recently - he was an unassuming professor who greatly contributed to today&#39;s electronic devices with his lithium-ion battery invention. Goodreads website has good features to help generate excitement, but it can also backfire when books are review bombed before publication. Scientists have found areas in the US that are at risk for greater flooding due to intensifying rains. Fox news network is shuffling up its prime time lineup after Carlonson was taken off air which dropped ratings by around one-third without him. The US government has funded a 5 billion dollar program aiming to make better Covid vaccines but vaccine makers don&#39;t understand any of the regulatory guidance.</p>

<h3>With Wagner’s Future in Doubt, Ukraine Could Capitalize on Chaos</h3>
<sub>By Julian E. Barnes and Thomas Gibbons-Neff</sub>
<p>The group played an outsize role in the campaign to take Bakhmut, Moscow’s one major battlefield victory this year.

<h3>In Isolated Guam, Abortion Is Legal. And Nearly Impossible to Get.</h3>
<sub>By David W. Chen and Noriko Hayashi</sub>
<p>The tiny U.S. territory in the western Pacific Ocean is thousands of miles from the nearest state, and has no resident doctors who perform abortions.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
