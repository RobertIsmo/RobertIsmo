<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. For example, there&#39;s an investigation into a group of Russian military soldiers who have allegedly killed dozens of people in Ukraine. In the US, there have been developments in the issue of immigration policy and spending packages, as President Zelensky has visited Washington and made a important speech. Over in London, people can enjoy all kinds of flavors during a weekend visit. Finally, there&#39;s an ongoing discussion about accountabilty and justice surrounding the events of January 6th.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
