<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, the Supreme Court recently released a decision impacting college admissions that has some conservatives promising to monitor and if necessary, go back to court. Also in the US, due to a recent ruling, universities could start changing how they evaluate applicants. Across large parts of the US there is pollution due to smoke from wildfires in Canada and temperatures are rising in the south and west.

In France, there have been protests after a police officer fatally shot a teenage driver. There were more than 600 people arrested after the third night of riots and the government is having a crisis meeting. Also, journalists at a leading newspaper are striking because they feel an appointed editor will turn it into a right-wing platform.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
