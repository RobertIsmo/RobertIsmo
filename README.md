<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, there has been record amounts of rainfall in Southern California, leading to flooding and evacuations. They&#39;re expecting more storms this week in the coastal towns of Santa Cruz that were already badly hit. In terms of economics, the Fed might finally be winning the war on inflation, but it could come with a great cost. Joe Biden has proposed changes to federal student loan repayment plans, which could reduce monthly payments for many borrowers. In politics, House Republicans passed new rules that makes it easier to remove the House Speaker and harder to raise taxes. They also voted to rescind IRS funding. 

Elsewhere in the world, there is growing concern about what &#39;security guarantees&#39; towards Ukraine mean and whether NATO membership will satisfy Kyiv and deter Moscow. In the Philippines, two notorious dynasties won landslide election victories for 2022. And in Shanghai, there has been a massive Covid surge and overcrowded funeral homes.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
