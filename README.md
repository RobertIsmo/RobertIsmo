<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is continuing to experience the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis. Banks are rebounding from recent losses, but worry from investors remains. Technology companies, particularly Meta, are making cutbacks due to global economic shift and efficiency initiatives. China is revamping its regulatory framework in order to exert more control over its banking system, while Russians are fleeing their country and an increasing number of countries are impacted by the change in demographics. In addition, extreme weather patterns are becoming larger and more severe around the globe, with droughts and floods on the rise. In the US, a major snowstorm is moving across the Northeast and California is experiencing heavy rains with extensive flooding expected. All of this combined is creating a very uncertain economic and environmental future.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
