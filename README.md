<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, tensions are high between China and the United States over climate change. In Belarus, there is a video suggesting Wagner leader visited to address his troops. In Israel, protests are brewing over the government&#39;s plans to overhaul the judiciary. Meanwhile, in Alaska, an endangered species of salmon is on the brink of extinction.  In the US, Stanford president Marc Tessier-Lavigne will be resigning after criticism of his research emerged. In addition, economists are uncertain about how a potential recession could play out for the US economy. To fight against climate change, we have seen a surge of lawyers suing Big Oil companies for damages. On the entertainment side, this weekend has two major movies - &#39;Barbie&#39; and &#39;Oppenheimer&#39; - being released and critics are divided on their view of both.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
