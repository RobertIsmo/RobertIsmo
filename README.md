<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
At the Supreme Court in the US, recent decisions have involved a voting map in Alabama that threatened to dilute black voters&#39; power, a trademark dispute involving a dog toy resembling a liquor bottle, and an aggravated identity theft law. On the world stage, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the area affected by floods and Russian shelling, while in China mosque domes and minarets were removed resulting in rare resistance. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump is using his familiar playbook to try to undermine documents related to his handling of classified material after leaving office. Additionally, there has been speculation around who will be running for president in 2024 with Talk Show host Pat Robertson who gave Christian conservatives clout recently passing away. Finally, on a more personal note, a couple of newlyweds are seeking an upper west side home that all their children want to visit.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
