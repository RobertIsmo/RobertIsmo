<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world in regards to the economy and government regulations. Banks are collapsing one after the other due to looser financial requirements for midsize banks, and this has provoked a ferocious popular backlash in Washington as some people worry it may be becoming a bailout situation. There&#39;s also a lot of attention on Silicon Valley and its vulnerabilities being exposed as a result. 

In addition, there have been several natural occurrences around the world like a major snowstorm hitting the northeast US, plus more widespread heavy rain coming down in California after an atmospheric river that already caused flooding. 

On the political front, Russian citizens are fleeing their country due to the war and quickly reshaping societies of countries whom they took refuge in. Meanwhile, Russia&#39;s mercenary chief is maneuvering on their home front, preparing for a political advance with Vladimir Putin&#39;s favor. 

And finally, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the Turkish city of Antakya recently, resulting in thousands of buildings being collapsed and potentially many more that may have to come down soon.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
