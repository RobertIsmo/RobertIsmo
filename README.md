<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a few different stories in the news recently. A judge has released three parts of a report about President Trump&#39;s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman is being treated for severe clinical depression after surviving a near-fatal stroke last year, as he works to adjust to life in the Senate. Meanwhile, there&#39;s been some speculation on social media about the effects of a train derailment that happened recently in Ohio, and Russia&#39;s military capabilities are being questioned after a failed battle for a city in Ukraine. There are also lots of abortion bills being considered and a religious exception to the prohibition against carrying was recently granted for Orthodox Jews living in Brooklyn. Finally, there&#39;s an upcoming revival of the popular comedy show Party Down that people are excited about.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
