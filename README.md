<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In technology, OpenAI recently forced its CEO Sam Altman out of his role after 48 hours of intense negotiations. In world news, there&#39;s been a strike on a United Nations-run school in Gaza that killed at least 24 people. Closer to home, Rosalynn Carter, the former US First Lady and political partner to her husband Jimmy Carter, passed away at age 96 and is being remembered for her humanitarian work and mental health advocacy. Overseas, Argentina recently elected Javier Milei from the far right in what many are calling a global victory for the ultraderechta. At the same time, African artists are driving a cultural renaissance through digital connections with their diaspora. In the US, people are questioning why the government is so addicted to technology by Elon Musk despite declaring his views as repugnant. There&#39;s also an incredible story of a cancer patient who passed away but managed to raise nearly $220,000 in her last wish to pay off $20 million in medical debt from others. And finally, Dubai is expending billions of dollars to provide fresh water to its residents and tourist attractions but experts think it&#39;s straining the Persian Gulf&#39;s natural resources. Meanwhile here, Joe Biden is about to turn 81 and there&#39;s no plans for any public celebration, as Democrats strategize for how to keep voters from worrying too much about his age by next year’s election.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
