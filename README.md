<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, there has been a recent attack by Hamas terrorists which has sparked much online controversy surrounding claims of atrocities. There have also been reports of long wait times for rescue efforts to help those victims. In the US, there are new accusations and divisions among the Republican Party, and the Supreme Court is deliberating on a case concerning partisan voting maps. On the business side, the Federal Reserve is closely observing economic growth as investors predict that interest rates will stay put. In terms of art and culture, hip-hop is having its Olympic moment but breaking dance pioneers worry if it will translate into sport. Lastly, AI technology has enabled fast diagnosis of brain tumors while investigations have found major air traffic control lapses that almost lead to disaster.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
