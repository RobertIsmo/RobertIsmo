<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In New York, former president Santos&#39;s lies were known to some well-connected Republicans, but were ignored. Russia has made a claim to seize a Ukrainian town, and goods are getting to Russia through a long line of trucks coming from Georgia. In Kyiv, Ukraine&#39;s capital, there have been explosions after days of relative calm due to Russian forces targeting them with missiles and drones. 

On the economic front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen has said that the debt limit will be reached on Thursday, and President Biden is now facing a special prosecutor for his documents inquiry like every president before him, apart from one. Sweden just announced that it has uncovered Europe&#39;s largest deposit of rare earth minerals used in electric vehicles and other green technologies. In Germany, an entire village was cleared out due to a fight over coal and climate change; and in New York City overdose deaths are at an all-time high due to fentanyl use. 

Also, President Biden and Japan&#39;s Foreign Minister Kishida just had a meeting where they discussed tensions with China, North Korea and Russia and plans for deterrence in Asia with U.S. troops and missiles. And sadly Elvis Presley&#39;s daughter Lisa Marie Presley has passed away recently and her fans have gone to Graceland to remember her at the stone wall outside his estate.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
