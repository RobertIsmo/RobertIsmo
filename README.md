<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on right now in politics and business. In the US, Speaker Kevin McCarthy is under pressure from right-wing Republicans in Congress who want more spending cuts and tougher border policies, but the White House and Senate are opposing those plans. Meanwhile, countries in Europe are rushing to build up their defenses in response to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, but there isn&#39;t consensus yet on how to do it. On a lighter note, Joe Biden&#39;s campaign team is doing an ad blitz and reassuring voters about his age despite his low approval ratings. Plus over 30 candidates have qualified for the next Republican presidential debate, but Donald Trump might not be one of them. 

In other places around the world, in Morocco after a devastating earthquake people are growing frustrated with their government’s slow response and reluctance to accept foreign aid. There’s also a rescue effort underway in Libya after a dam collapsed during a big storm and swept entire neighborhoods into the sea. To top it off, Google is heading to trial over accusations that it has monopoly power and is illegally stifling its competitors.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
