<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of interesting challenges and developments going on in the world. On one hand, health care giants have been profiting off artery-clearing procedures that could put patients at risk for amputations. In Hollywood, workers are striking and trying to negotiate the economics of streaming while trying to remain culturally dominant. In Ukraine, Russians are actively trying to push their agenda and Ukrainian leaders are struggling to build up enough forces to fight back. Here in the US, it&#39;s been hot! We&#39;ve had heat waves with record-high temperatures mainly out West. And it seems like people are rethinking their strategies for dealing with the heatwave. Finally, over at Wimbledon, Marketa Vondrousova from the Czech Republic won her first Grand Slam and Ons Jabeur of Tunisia called it &quot;the most painful&quot; loss of her career.</p>

<h3>The Gilgo Beach Victims Were Always More Than Escorts</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
