<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the U.S., there has been a review of police discrimination in Minneapolis since George Floyd was murdered and efforts to &quot;defund the police&quot; have not been successful. Meanwhile, former President Trump has been prosecuted, and the polls suggest it has hurt his popularity among Republicans. In England, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to honor allies but failed and is now having disputes with the current PM. Southern Baptists&#39; decision to oust women from leadership roles has offered an insight into Evangelical America&#39;s psyche ahead of 2024. Further, a unique EV ride-sharing program has brought low-cost clean transportation to California&#39;s Central Valley while miniature antiwar protesters in Russia are using symbols to demonstrate opposition to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. Finally, lastly, floodwaters recently freed some people who were stranded in Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine.</p>

<h3>What Has Happened in Minneapolis Since George Floyd Was Murdered</h3>
<sub>By Adeel Hassan</sub>
<p>A 2022 state review found that racial discrimination was endemic in the Police Department.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43XJ3uk"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>What happened to efforts to ‘defund the police’ in Minneapolis and elsewhere?</h3>
<sub>By Ernesto Londoño</sub>
<p>The movement faltered after activists failed to build broad support for a goal that lacked a clear definition. When crime surged, Republicans seized on it as evidence that Democrats were being recklessly soft on crime.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3qLsIuL"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>In Trump Prosecution, Special Counsel Seeks to Avoid Distracting Fights</h3>

<p>Jack Smith has taken an iron-fist-in-a-kid-glove approach, sidestepping secondary issues that could divert attention from the weight of the evidence he has assembled in his case against the former president.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3qIHylz"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>See How the G.O.P. Has Reacted to the Trump Indictment</h3>
<sub>By Karen Yourish and Charlie Smart</sub>
<p>More than half of the Republicans in Congress have made public statements about Trump’s federal indictment. Most are not pleased.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/442lDEf"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Trump and Johnson Were Accused of Breaking Rules. One Lost Party Support.</h3>

<p>Donald J. Trump and Boris Johnson are at the heart of political tempests at home, facing different accusations and far different results.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/469Mbp9"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Boris Johnson’s Effort to Honor Allies Puts Glare on House of Lords</h3>

<p>The former prime minister tried to elevate some lawmakers, as British leaders do when they leave office. But three didn’t make the cut, and now he’s fighting with Rishi Sunak.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43ZIa4x"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
