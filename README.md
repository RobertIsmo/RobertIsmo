<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of major stories unfolding right now. In the US, President Biden is releasing his new budget proposal and economists are warning that refusing to raise the nation&#39;s borrowing cap could lead to millions being put out of work. Meanwhile, the Fed Chair has opened the door to faster rate hikes and higher interest rates. In terms of taxes, there&#39;s a proposal that targets Americans earning more than $400,000 a year, in order to bolster Medicare. On the immigration front, the US government is looking into bringing back detention for migrant families. 

In other parts of the world, a Russian soldier died in Ukraine after heeding Russia&#39;s call to enlist, exposing how far the Kremlin is willing to go to cover up its involvement there. In Mexico, authorities are investigating reports of spying by their armed forces which has sparked fears of a &quot;military state,&quot; and four Americans have been kidnapped from Matamoros on a trip for medical help.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
