<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The US House of Representatives is in the midst of voting for the new Speaker, while 20 Republicans have been deemed to be far-right leaning. In sports, NFL players are grappling with the violent consequences of the game, while Damar Hamlin recently suffered a cardiac arrest during a game. In terms of technology, Meta has been ruled illegal under EU law and Salesforce will be laying off 10% of its staff due to economic slowdown. Tesla&#39;s market capitalization had a huge sell-off and Coinbase reached a $100 million settlement with New York regulators. There are also two new movies that provide an unfamiliar discourse around the #MeToo movement, and some Brazilians fear the Amazon may soon &quot;tip&quot; into becoming a savanna. To top it off, California is bracing for some more severe flooding from an incoming storm!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
