<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of events happening in the world lately. Elon Musk has become a dominant force in satellite internet technology, raising global alarms. In Ukraine, Russia is continuing an aggressive campaign against its ports which has forced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make difficult decisions about how to protect his country. In the US, cities like Portland, Oregon are dealing with homelessness paired with a fentanyl epidemic which has become a deadly crisis. Former President Donald J. Trump is also facing new charges that he allegedly tried to meddle with prosecutors during his time in office. In addition, e-bikes and their associated risks are becoming increasingly popular among teenagers and adults alike. There&#39;s also been unrest in Israel over a law limiting judicial power, which has sparked hundreds of resignations from military reservists. Other parts of the world like Niger and Africa have been experiencing coups; and Canada is being ravaged by fires that have disproportionately affected Indigenous people who rely on forests for sustenance. And closer to home, lower-income border towns in the US face a &quot;dangerous combination&quot; of extreme heat and water cutoffs during a record-setting summer.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
