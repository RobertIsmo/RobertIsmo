<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, there are reports of troops being exposed to weapons that could cause serious brain injuries, and a commutation for a drug smuggler that may have connections to the Trump family. There&#39;s also an investigation into Trump&#39;s pardon for Jonathan Braun. Meanwhile, life in Gaza is incredibly tough due to practically no fuel or coal, and Hamas has declared a commander dead.

On the international front, there are stories about finding moral centers during war times and the experience of a Holocaust refugee coming to New York City. In West Africa, a program is providing access to mental health counseling by training hairdressers. 

Finally, there is news about members of the US Congress heading for the exits, setting up fights for 2024 control, and Johnson&#39;s rise with the GOP becoming more right-wing than expected.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
