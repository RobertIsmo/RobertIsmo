<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a number of things happening in the world right now that could affect people around the globe. For example, Russia is threatening small ports along the Danube River, which is a vital shipping outlet for Ukraine. In the US, there has been a run of strong data buoying President Biden on the economy. Although he rates poorly on economic issues, there are signs that the national mood is improving. Meanwhile, Ron DeSantis’s Super PAC has reportedly burned through $34 million as he slides in polls. Also, a ban on traditional bulbs has gone into effect due to efforts to reduce energy consumption. On a more somber note, Sheila Oliver, New Jersey&#39;s first Black woman to hold statewide elected office, has passed away. Additionally, thousands of migrants have been forced to sleep on the sidewalk because of a failing shelter system in NYC. Lastly, Fitch recently downgraded the U.S. credit rating due to debt-limit standoffs eroding confidence in fiscal management.</p>

<h3>Bulb Becomes a Flashpoint as the Sun Sets on Incandescent Lights</h3>
<sub>By Katie Rogers</sub>
<p>A ban on most kinds of traditional bulbs renews a cultural squabble between regulatory efforts to curb energy consumption and the very American impulse to do whatever one wants in one’s domicile.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/47cpgtL"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
