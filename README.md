<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there have been a number of major developments recently: a liberal judge ran on abortion rights and won in Wisconsin, Brandon Johnson won a Chicago mayoral race after coming in second in the first ballot, and Donald Trump was recently arraigned with charges brought against him. Tensions are also running high between the US and China after Speaker Kevin McCarthy met with Taiwan&#39;s president at home, and the Republicans have vowed to grill the New York prosecutor bringing charges against the former president. 
On the international stage, Ukrainian President Zelensky visited Poland, where their leaders backed Ukraine&#39;s bid for NATO membership. At UN events, Russia has been accused of misinforming delegates and spreading disinformation. And an Australian miners&#39; rebellion led by a Black man named John Joseph has been rediscovered. Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch is being forced to testify in a defamation trial and Baltimore officials have revealed hundreds of children and teens were abused by Catholic clergy.</p>

<h3>Trump’s Charges Bring Doubts, Hopes and Uncertainty in Both Parties</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
