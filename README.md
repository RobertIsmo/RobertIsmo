<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot happening in the US and around the world lately. In the US, Representative Kevin McCarthy said he would leave Congress at the end of the year after being ousted as speaker. There&#39;s also been an effort to hold Hunter Biden accountable with a contempt charge, but the G.O.P chairmen have refused to allow him to testify publicly. There has also been backlash to the president of University of Pennsylvania Elizabeth Magill over her remarks at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on campuses.

Around the world, people in Gaza have been living in fear due to Israel airstrikes targeting Rafah, where Israel had encouraged Gazans to seek safety. In response, President Biden called on Congress to approve aid for Ukraine before funds run out by the end of year. There are also charges against 4 Russian soldiers for war crimes against an American, as well as an investigation into Hamas fighters’ attack in Israel that killed more than 30 Americans.

In other news, television producer Norman Lear, who changed the face of TV with his comedies, recently passed away at 101 years old. The White House also delayed a decision on banning menthol cigarettes due to mounting opposition from tobacco companies, Black activists, and small businesses as President Biden enters into an election year. Lastly, nations have been trying to tackle A.I.&#39;s harms by responding to rapid technological advances with policies and deciding how A.I. should or could be regulated.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
