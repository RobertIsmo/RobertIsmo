<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is facing a multitude of challenges. In the United States, gun-control activists are pushing for stronger legislation after a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. Meanwhile, wildflower preservationists in California are on a mission to protect rare plants before their window of opportunity closes. Overseas, Ukraine has been devastated by war, while Romania is making an example out of an online influencer accused of human trafficking and rape. Additionally, Colorado is celebrating an agreement to keep its river from drying up, while Mexico&#39;s president is facing controversy over spying directed at his ally. Finally, Facebook owner Meta has been fined $1.3 billion for violating European Union data privacy rules.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
