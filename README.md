<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening in the world right now! Very soon, Congress could be dealing with a debt limit crisis if key leaders can&#39;t reach a compromise. Protesters in South Carolina just successfully caused their Senate to pass a 6-week abortion ban, and it looks like it will become law. On the political front, Florida governor Ron DeSantis is likely going to announce his 2024 presidential bid on Twitter this week. Meanwhile, Major League Baseball has made changes to their rules that are dramatically speeding up the games while leading to more exciting action.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
