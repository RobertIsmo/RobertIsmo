<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is happening in the world right now. In the US, there&#39;s a controversial case involving police violence that is being questioned after video evidence revealed a different story than what officers initially reported. In response, two more Memphis police officers have been suspended and Tyre Nichols&#39;s parents have been invited to attend the State of the Union address. Internationally, the world economy is looking up with inflation easing and the IMF upgrading its global outlook. We&#39;re also seeing progress on Covid 19 with the US plan to end public health emergency in May, but conflict continues in Ukraine where they are asking allies to speed up delivery of weaponry amid government forces being geared for a Russian offensive. Lastly, there&#39;s some intense international political drama between Secretary of State Blinken and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Finally, closer to home some our usual sports stars in Philly are playing in the Super Bowl and hopefully their win will break the inglorious history of past losses!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
