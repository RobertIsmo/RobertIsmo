<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening in the world right now. In Gaza, the UN is warning that half of the population is at risk of starving due to a lack of food and resources. The US and Israel recently had a tense conflict over the Israel-Hamas war of 2023. Meanwhile Ukraine and other countries in the region have switched to guerrilla tactics as missiles fall. Meanwhile in the US, there are tensions between Asian American employees in counterintelligence jobs and their American peers. There&#39;s also been some changes to gun laws in California. Meanwhile college sports has changed due to increased cash payments from fan &quot;collectives&quot;. Lastly, there are some opinion pieces about finding joy despite the darkness in the world, and managing water resources and rising temperatures in the American Southwest.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
