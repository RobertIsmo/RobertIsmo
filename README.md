<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. On the climate front, U.N. Chief António Guterres is calling out planet wreckers ahead of a United Nations climate summit this week without naming anyone specific. In terms of science, there’s a vanishing nomadic clan living in Indonesia’s rainforest that has kept an oral history, which was recently confirmed by genetic research. Canada has made a startling claim against India over separatist issues that has caused tension between the two countries. 

On the business side of things, the Federal Reserve is inching closer towards ending rate increases, while the United Auto Workers union went on strike as they decide whether it will accelerate worker action or stop labor&#39;s recent momentum. Businesses are also struggling with expectations to work in China while dealing with confusing regulations and an increased security focus.

In one part of America, Los Angeles has avoided the migrant crisis confronting New York City, likely due to it no longer being such an attractive destination for immigrants. The Times recently did an investigation on child labor and how it relates to migration issues at the border.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
