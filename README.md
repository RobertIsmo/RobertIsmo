<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot going on in the world! In the US, the government is pressing Israel for ceasefires so that aid can reach those in Gaza.  Elsewhere, there is a cycle of violence and extremism between Israeli settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank as well as increasing traditional gender roles in China. In Egypt, some evacuees from Gaza are finally feeling relief and gratitude after being allowed to leave.  In America, there are FBI raids of homes in cities such as New York with regards to mayoral fund-raising chief cases.  More broadly, there are issues arising with regards to protecting American water sources as well as Olympic hopefuls who are finding places to live and train. There was also a high profile criminal investigation into the death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis which led to charges against a former officer. Lastly, people are paying close attention to effects of high interest rates on the economy, as well as changes to federal banking regulations.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
