<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of conflict happening in the world. Russia is facing attacks from Ukraine, leading to the death of at least a dozen Russian civilians and displacement of thousands more. Meanwhile, NATO countries are running a large-scale air force exercise with over 250 aircraft from 24 countries. Here in the US, former President Donald Trump has been indicted and must appear in court this week for a documents case. In Italy, Silvio Berlusconi, who dominated politics and culture for over 20 years has passed away. Scientists have been warning us about how noise levels can take years off your life, so it&#39;s important to monitor yourself. There&#39;s also a story out of New York about Love Canal being America&#39;s first Superfund Site and being uninformedly inhabited by people now. In Senegal, protests over police brutality resulted in several deaths resulting in uproar in the nation. Lastly, the US electric grid isn&#39;t able to handle the energy transition which will need long-distance power lines to transport wind and solar power across the country. JPMorgan is also paying $290 million in settlement with victims of Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s sex abuse as well. Lastly, the 76th Tony Awards happened this past week and there were many best and worst moments to come from it!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
