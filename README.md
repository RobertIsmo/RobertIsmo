<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To close friend, 

The world is going through a lot right now. Police violence has been a very prominent topic in the news and people are speaking out against it. There&#39;s been a video of Memphis police beating Tyre Nichols that has caused widespread horror. Protests have been sparked across the country in response to the incident. 

In terms of international news, Israel is facing a spasm of violence due to the government&#39;s far-right views, which have raised the risk of an escalation. At least 7 people have been killed in an attack in East Jerusalem. 

Pharmaceutical companies have been pushing up prices and monopolizing products, taking advantage of patent systems in the US and costing us all dearly. And we&#39;re also getting more updates from Ukraine - Russian forces are escalating their assaults on strategic towns and Donald Trump is posting more extreme views on social media platforms again as he tries to get support for a potential third White House run. 

It&#39;s been quite a turbulent period - let me know if you need to talk about anything. 
Take care!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
