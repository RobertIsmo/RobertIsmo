<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>The world is a chaotic place right now. There are shootings in the US prompting calls for action on gun control that are being rejected by the GOP. India does not have an opposition leader anymore following Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#39;s power to silence potential challengers. In Ukraine, there is the looming threat of a conflict involving their largest nuclear plant. Meanwhile, here in the US issues such as housing crisis are ongoing, with the Democratic House putting pressure on New York Governor Hochul to act on climate change. Plus, there&#39;s were two cases of gay people being robbed and murdered in Hell&#39;s Kitchen. It looks like Trump is back too, making his first Fox News appearance in months, but being met with a chilly reception from its hosts.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
