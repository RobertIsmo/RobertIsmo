<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, President Trump is facing legal issues that could interfere with his campaign. Joe Biden has taken shots at Republicans, but is staying silent about any Trump indictments. There&#39;s also potential criminal charges related to civil rights violations in voting fraud cases. 
In Europe, there&#39;s a heat wave making things difficult for tourists and older people, which China appears to be exacerbating with their addiction to coal. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, the war with Russia is making it hard for pediatric cancer patients and their families to get good treatment. Britain&#39;s spy chief has suggested that Putin struck a deal with a mercenary leader to keep his power secure. 
Elsewhere, abortion laws are in flux due to a Supreme Court decision and networks of volunteers are doing their best trying to fill in health care gaps created by the decision. Finally, in an attempt to influence US thinking on China, Xi Jinping has turned to old American friendships like Henry Kissinger.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
