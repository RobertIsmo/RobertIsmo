<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been voted out of his position in a surprise move that will leave the House in chaos. Matt Gaetz, a polarizing figure in Congress, is also facing criticism in his home district. Former President Trump was recently reprimanded for attacking a judge&#39;s staff on social media. Additionally, he has stirred up controversy with a recent comment about shoplifting. 

The Justice Department is also locking up thousands of undocumented immigrants as witnesses without charges. In Russia, people are still required to serve their country in military service and there is a struggle to keep alive a Turkic language spoken in Moldova. There are also health concerns such as insulin resistance, a condition experts suggest we keep an eye on.</p>

<h3>McCarthy Is Ousted as Speaker, Leaving the House in Chaos</h3>
<sub>By Catie Edmondson</sub>

<h3>McCarthy’s Extraordinary Downfall Reflects an Ungovernable G.O.P.</h3>

<p>The glib Californian made many promises and paid a price when he was unable to fulfill them.

<h3>Jailed by the Thousands, Without Charges, to Act as Witnesses</h3>

<h3>When Russia Is a Neighbor, Self-Defense Is Everyone’s Concern</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
