<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of interesting developments happening all around the world recently. In Canada there&#39;s an increase in people crossing over illegally from the USA, leading to calls to shut down a border road. In Ukraine, the mayor of Kherson has gone missing while his decision to stay in his post during Russian occupation is stirring up divided opinions. In the US, the House Ethics Committee opened an inquiry on George Santos and the Justice Department said a lawsuit against Donald Trump over the Capitol attack should proceed. Further away, Wayne Shorter, an innovator of jazz passed away at 89. Closer to home, a couple in Queens was on the market for their first home and were able to find one with their budget!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
