<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a pretty tumultuous year all around. Here&#39;s some of the biggest news that happened in the US and around the world. In the US, Trump had a rough Jan. 6th as a House panel released a report that may back criminal charges against him and a separate committee could release his taxes. A trial against the Proud Boys is opening to focus on their role in Jan. 6th violence, government conspiracy charges were brought up similar to those against members of an Oath Keepers militia. 

In China, there was a U-turn in their Covid strategy as, after micromanaging it for nearly three years, their leader Xi Jinping now leaves the populace to improvise. Bots pushing adult content also dominated Chinese protest tweets by swarming posts. 

In NY region, a Rep.-elect named George Santos may have misrepresented his career highlights on his résumé and Elon Musk asked Twitter whether he should stay as boss. Internationally, almost every country signed on to a sweeping deal to protect nature - except the United States - and Qatar got the spotlight it sought when hosting the World Cup. Finally, photographers captured historic moments of war, grief and wonder worldwide and Maxwell Frost&#39;s housing troubles showed how tough it can be for Gen Z to rent an apartment. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
