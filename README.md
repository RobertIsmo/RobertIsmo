<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of news happening around the world right now! In the US, there has been unhealthy air in New York City which will linger through Thursday morning. Also, Chris Licht has left CNN after a turbulent year running the 24-hour news organization and a new leader must be found to continue the network&#39;s financial future. Elsewhere, there has been a dam breach in Ukraine that flooded several villages. Vice President Pence recently gave a speech against former President Donald Trump and is now competing against him in the upcoming election. On the sports side, there&#39;s a big deal merging LIV Golf with the PGA Tour which Saudi Arabia is relishing as a triumph that transcends sports.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
