<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening all around the world right now. In Israel, there are large protests over a plan by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to overhaul the judiciary system. In Ukraine, soldiers are pushing Russian forces back in a battle near Bakhmut. In the US, the government is considering vaccinating chickens to deal with an outbreak of bird flu that has killed millions of birds and raised concerns about a human pandemic. Republican votes have helped the US pile up debt and increase its deficit. And in California, there is an increasing amount of &quot;zombie&quot; forests that are out of sync with the warming climate due to past wildfires. Finally, the Biden administration is looking at potential measures it can take against apps like TikTok that could expose US citizens&#39; data to China.</p>

<h3>Protests Over Netanyahu’s Judiciary Overhaul Spread to Israel’s Military</h3>
<sub>By Ronen Bergman and Patrick Kingsley</sub>
<p>The military leadership is concerned that anger over the government’s plan, with some pilots saying they will skip some training sessions and operations, could diminish military capabilities.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ZLruMg"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Ukrainian Soldiers, Nearly Encircled, Push Russians Back</h3>

<p>The battle for Bakhmut is not over — at least not yet. Ukrainian assault brigades offered Moscow a bloody reminder of that over the weekend.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/41MEQtn"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>U.S. Considers Vaccinating Chickens as Bird Flu Kills Millions of Them</h3>

<h3>The MAGA-fication of North Idaho College</h3>

<h3>Republican Votes Helped Washington Pile Up Debt</h3>

<h3>The Programs You’d Have to Cut to Balance the Budget</h3>

<p>Without trimming popular programs or raising taxes, cuts to the rest of the federal budget would have to be monumental.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3msd1Xd"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Can a Czech Firefighter Compete With M.L.B.’s Biggest Stars?</h3>

<h3>Historical Disputes Kept Them at Odds. Can Seoul and Tokyo Make Amends?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
