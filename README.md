<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a few major things going on in the world. In the U.S., there are questions being raised over former President Donald Trump&#39;s handling of documents and President Biden&#39;s retaining of classified documents. There&#39;s also an ongoing special counsel investigation into Trump, and 4 GOP Congressmen calling for George Santos to resign from office due to past lies. Plus, Hunter Biden&#39;s tangled legal issues are coming to the forefront with potential indictments and hearings, and House Republicans plan to investigate the Biden administration for potential impeachment. On an international level, Russia has replaced its war commander for the conflict in Ukraine and is facing signs of internal dissension. Lastly, California is experiencing storms that might or might not end their drought, creating weather whiplash that could be worrying for many Californians.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
