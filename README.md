<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, there is attention on whether Hunter Biden had an unfair deal and Trump and other political candidates have been pushing claims of injustice. Additionally, a judge has set a tentative trial date for when documents regarding Trump may be dealt with. Meanwhile, an agreement between Trump&#39;s real estate company and a Saudi firm has raised ethical concerns. On another note, questions have arisen what the consequences would be if a Presidential candidate is convicted of something. Overseas, five people are missing after getting aboard a submersible and Ukrainian P.O.W&#39;s are being released but have suffered beatings and inadequate nutrition during their captivity. Chelsea FC was sold recently and money meant to go to war victims hasn&#39;t yet been transferred due to bureaucratic issues. There is also tension between the US and China as they perceive each other differently. Lastly, three people were convicted in New Jersey for harassing people on behalf of China&#39;s government. On the business front, Alibaba&#39;s CEO is stepping down with two co-founders taking over his position.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
