<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is changing quickly and events are happening everywhere. In the Middle East, climate change is putting additional strain on the Fertile Crescent, causing extreme temperatures and water shortages. In the US, there&#39;s been a secret history of gun rights as legislators have been working with the National Rifle Association to shape laws, courts and views on the Second Amendment. Ukraine is currently going through a tough counterattack with Russian defenses impeding progress. There has also been a wave of strikes from drones targeting Moscow in Russia. Video gamers are being targeted with Russian propaganda, while North Carolina politics have blown up due to a party switch by a prominent Democrat. Pakistan recently experienced a deadly blast at a political rally killing dozens, while California&#39;s Montecito area is home to wealthier celebrities and influencers dreaming of the New American Dream. New York City hired an expert to move hundreds of asylum seekers outside the city, but reports say they&#39;ve been mistreated and lied to in the process. Meanwhile, college alumni are debating reversal of legacy admissions policies since the Supreme Court weakened race-based programs, and Donald Trump is facing legal trouble due to millions of dollars he has requested for refunds for his lawyer fees. Lastly, Trump has threatened Republicans who don&#39;t help him exact vengeance or risk facing consequences in future elections.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
