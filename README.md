<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some concerning developments in the world lately. In China, nearly 60,000 Covid-linked deaths have been reported since restrictions were lifted, and a severe outbreak is happening in Shanghai. Recently, another new dominant strain of Covid called the XBB.1.5 variant has emerged in the Northeast and is causing a surge in cases. On the political side, some additional documents have been found at Joe Biden&#39;s Wilmington home and a special counsel is investigating how they got there. In Russia, there is an ongoing art heist targeting Ukraine&#39;s cultural heritage, while in California, giant atmospheric rivers are drenching the state. Lastly, truffle hunting is becoming a dangerous activity due to people using poison on dogs who accompany truffle hunters.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
