<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening around the world right now. In Canada, there is an international dispute between Canada and India over the killing of a Sikh leader named Hardeep Singh Nijjar. In the US, there is a lot of political divide as some Republicans have been trying to cause dysfunction and stir up chaos in their party. In New Jersey, Senator Robert Menendez is being charged with bribery charges in relation to alleged bribes he accepted from various sources. In Ukraine, an American army hospital is treating Ukrainians that were wounded in combat and Russia has claimed that Ukrainian forces have targeted Crimea for two days in a row. There are also ongoing labor talks at 3 Detroit automakers, while the uptick of Covid 19 infections has caused some debate about wearing masks in hospitals. Additionally, broadcasters are now focusing on aging Boomers as viewers for their prime-time lineups and a new dating show has been created featuring singles over 60.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
