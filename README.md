<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In tech, a lot of companies are having to make layoffs, particularly affecting young workers. Google&#39;s parent company Alphabet is cutting 12,000 jobs globally. On the lighter side, Google just got help from its founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to boost its artificial intelligence development.

In other news, the potential arms trade between Germany and Ukraine is getting attention since the latter wants to use Leopard 2 tanks in its military efforts. Closer to home, issues around abortion have Republican politicians debating what restrictive measures should be taken. In Haiti, a mother has taken extraordinary measures to try and save her daughter trapped by violence. And speaking of extreme steps, President Biden&#39;s White House had to stay quiet for 68 days about a classified information scandal. 

Finally, there&#39;s been some goodbye news recently - New Zealander Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is stepping down after making it through countless national crises; and musician David Crosby has passed away, leaving behind 15 essential songs that spanned generations.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
