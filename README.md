<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like former President Donald Trump is in some serious legal trouble, with appeals courts rejecting his latest effort to delay a fraud case against him. That could end up costing him control over some of his real estate properties, like Trump Tower. His legal defense is also coming under strain, with the Justice Department accusing his lawyers of dragging their feet.

Meanwhile, there are other people facing economic difficulty due to the pandemic in New York City, where the gap between rich and poor is growing even wider. There&#39;s also a story about migrants coming to New York City and trying to find places to live despite hostile conditions.

In the U.S., President Biden is facing a looming shutdown if Congress can&#39;t reach a deal, and there was an impeachment hearing about Biden with no new information revealed. And in Israel, there was a prayer meeting on Yom Kippur that sparked debate as the government is trying to weaken its judiciary system.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
