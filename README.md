<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are a bit tumultuous in the world right now. Retailers are making layoffs due to customer spending slowdowns and the Republican National Committee is moving away from President Trump&#39;s 2024 campaign. The Ukrainian war is escalating tensions in Europe and Biden agreed to send in tanks even though he was reluctant to do so. Over in America, immigrants are reeling from violence after a mass shooting of farmworkers in Half Moon Bay and a police beating has left people in Memphis worried and awaiting video footage. In New York City, there&#39;s a plan to expand composting citywide to target trash and rats, while Oslo is refashioning itself into a cultural hub with new museums and restaurants. Oh, and did I mention that there&#39;s been some insanely weird weather around? You can check out the winter snow reports for yourself!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
