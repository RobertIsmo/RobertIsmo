<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In China, they&#39;re using ships, water cannons, and bullhorns to form a wall of protection over their sea. It&#39;s one-third of the global ocean trade that goes through these waters. China also built a unique coast guard to gain more control over their seas. 

In North Carolina, Republicans are trying to seize more control over elections from the current Democratic governor. And many Republican presidential candidates have been brandishing their names in fashion statements - like wearing &quot;Ron DeSantis&quot; shirts or &quot;Tim Scott&quot; hats. 

Things are getting intense in Ukraine as the war intensifies. Moldova is also dealing with a fraudster taking advantage of the situation in one of its ethnic enclaves and it&#39;s causing all sorts of problems. The country has worked to revive exports of goods across their Black Sea despite Russian threats. 

Meanwhile, back at home, there&#39;s a dilemma over how to crack down on drug problems due to fentanyl use becoming increasingly fatal.  At the same time, there&#39;s questions about an unfounded claim that former prisoner was mistreated by Ron DeSantis at Guantanamo. 

Finally, gold mining has caused a huge problem due to mercury usage as an illegal part of mining not being removed even though an international treaty has been in place for 10 years.  It&#39;s poisoning people and even affecting your wedding rings!</p>

<h3>Republican Fashion Watch: Our Critic on 2024’s Hottest Trend</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
