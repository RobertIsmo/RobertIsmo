<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In New York, Donald Trump is set to become the first former president to be indicted, and he has just added a former US prosecutor to his defense team. In Russia, a blogger who was pro-war was killed, with the suspect being an antigovernment activist from Ukraine. On a brighter note, earlier this week UConn won its fifth NCAA title in a dominant performance against San Diego State. Unfortunately, millions of people enrolled in Medicaid may soon lose coverage due to the pandemic protections expiring.

In terms of climate news, California set record snowpack levels this year and scientists are using low-flying planes to measure them. There was also a sad incident that took place in Arizona recently where an unarmed Mexican man was shot while crossing a ranch - the ranch owner has been charged but it’s caused a backlash among his supporters. In the health world, Roland Griffiths, a psychedelics pioneer is heading out on an ultimate trip as he has stage 4 cancer. Even politics isn’t immune from what’s happening as republicans can’t seem to agree on their path out of their own debt crisis.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
