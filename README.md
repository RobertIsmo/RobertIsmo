<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are starting to heat up in the United States in terms of voting and election control. Some universities are trying out a new tool called &#39;adversity scores&#39;, which evaluates applicants based on their disadvantages, in order to increase diversity in admissions. Over in Ukraine, there&#39;s been a small battle between Russian forces and a volunteer Ukrainian unit, and it doesn&#39;t look like it will be resolved any time soon. 

On a lighter note, five voyagers recently had the chance to explore the wreck of the Titanic with a submersible, but the texts they sent kept coming up short. Treasury secretary Janet Yellin will be visiting China soon to lessen tensions between two of the largest economies in the world. Artificial intelligence is now making its way into math studies too, which has changed how mathematicians have been adapting issues of logic and reasoning for thousands of years. 

In America, there was a tragic shooting in Baltimore that left two dead and 28 wounded. And also there was one in Manhattan at Riverbank State Park that killed a 15-year-old boy. This Fourth of July should be an interesting one — some Americans are conflicted about celebrating due to crowds, politics or patriotism. Chicago and NASCAR have decided to partner up for a weekend street event with mixed reviews, and tennis star Andy Murray is once again ready for his long run at Wimbledon. Lastly, there&#39;s a YouTuber named Ms. Rachel who gathers millions of views from her series &#39;Songs for Littles&#39; — she teaches children through song!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
