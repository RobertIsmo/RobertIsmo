<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it seems like a lot is happening in the world. In the US, former vice president Mike Pence has been ordered to testify to a grand jury over the events of January 6th while President Biden admitted that he cannot act on gun control without help from Congress. In Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu is struggling to keep order within his own coalition amid a plan to weaken judicial power. This movement is drawing comparisons to other democracies that have gone in this direction. Meanwhile, there was a tragic fire in Mexico near the US border which killed 39 people at a migrant center. In other news, senators are questioning federal regulators over two bank failures while one Federal Reserve official believes the troubles spell an upcoming recession. Lastly, an antiwar father and daughter in Russia have been separated over their criticism of the war in Ukraine, and in anticipation of the coronation of King Charles, many look-alikes are enjoying newfound popularity.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
