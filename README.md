<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there is a case that may lead to parallel prosecutions of former President Trump and his allies after they allegedly conspired to change the outcome of the election. Hawaii has recently been ravaged by devastating wildfires, and President Biden has promised to visit soon. In the U.K., 5 people have been arrested on espionage charges linked to Russia. Closer to home, a former FBI spy hunter has pleaded guilty to aiding a Russian oligarch. Plus, teens in Philly convicted of life sentences are now being resentenced thanks in part to developments in the criminal justice system. On social media front, a new trend on TikTok known as MovieTok provides movie reviews from everyday personalities instead of traditional critics; and Brazil&#39;s biggest TV star, Xuxa, is issuing an apology for her role in idolizing white beauty standards in her home country. Additionally, China is having their own economic crisis with one of its biggest real estate developers teetering on default and global concerns growing over Beijing suppressing vital economic data. Finally, Hunter Biden&#39;s lawyer has stepped down from his case involving a Justice Department investigation. That’s the round-up for now!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
