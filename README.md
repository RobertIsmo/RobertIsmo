<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, start-ups are trying to bring the Silicon Valley ethos to the military-industrial complex. In Europe, the company Meta has been fined billions of dollars for violating data privacy rules. In Mexico, an ally of the president has been targeted by spyware. In Texas, tensions have flared following a school shooting in Uvalde. In California, rare wildflowers are popping up thanks to a wet winter. And in New York, police officers are being accused of covering up abuse in state prisons. Around the world, we&#39;re seeing human trafficking and rape charges filed against an influencer in Romania and angry protesters clanging saucepans against France&#39;s pensions law. Finally, technology companies are still struggling to find ways to prevent mislabeling people as animals using image analysis software.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
