<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s been a lot of discussion about the availability of abortion pills in the United States. A court recently imposed temporary restrictions on the drug, and some people are selling them overseas. Research has found that abortion pills are safe, but their use is restricted in many places.

On the international front, Russian officials are locked in a heated battle and leak scandal at home, and different narratives about Russia have been spread throughout Africa.

In the political sphere, President Trump is being questioned as he faces a lawsuit from the New York attorney general. And state legislatures seem to be divided by partisanship - all part of issues with democracy at the moment.

The world of sports is also seeing some upheaval, as the Women&#39;s Tennis Association recently announced it was lifting its suspension on Chinese tournaments after concerns over a Chinese star went unresolved.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
