<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of big developments happening around the world. In Israel, there have been huge protests over Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s plans to limit judicial influence. In China, a scientist has been promoting a program to watch the world from above using airships. Here in the US, we&#39;ve had an inquiry into Donald Trump&#39;s election and a judge is about to release parts of the report on it. There was also a powerful earthquake in Turkey and Syria, leaving many people homeless, and in need of temporary housing. We&#39;ve had politicians here in America facing legal jeopardy due to campaign finance irregularities too. On top of all this, there was an interesting football game where a referee&#39;s call cost the Eagles a win, and set up an impressive 65-yard punt return that secured Kansas City&#39;s comeback. Finally, Russian soldiers captured by Ukraine have reported being used as cannon fodder by commanders throwing waves of bodies into an assault.</p>

<h3>They Were Told Their Building Was Earthquake Safe. It Collapsed Anyway.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
