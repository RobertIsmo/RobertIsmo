<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. The US is currently debating gun laws before court and is facing scrutiny over its involvement in Gaza and Lebanon. Democrats in Congress are weighing calls for ceasefires amid pressure from the left, and Biden is confronting the limits of US leverage in two conflicts. On the economic front, a report card on Bidenomics was released and automakers are delaying electric vehicle spending as demand slows. Meanwhile, Barbra Streisand is getting ready to tell all about her life in a new memoir, President Trump&#39;s business empire is on trial, and King Charles III has been delivering speeches at odds with his beliefs.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
