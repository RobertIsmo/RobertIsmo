<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is some tension in the Middle East, as the U.S. national security adviser paid a visit to Israel, which had recently killed three of its own hostages accidentally during the Gaza War. In the U.S., disputes have arisen between former president Trump and Rudy Giuliani, with the latter being ordered to pay $148 million to election workers whom he wrongfully accused of trying to steal votes. Matthew Perry, known for his role in &quot;Friends&quot;, died of acute effects of ketamine according to his autopsy. Meanwhile, psychedelics are being researched for potential positive psychiatric effects, but also have dangerous side effects on certain individuals. In politics in the U.S., 43 Biden diplomatic nominees are being blocked by senators while a missing Russia investigation material may have been taken when Trump left office. There also has been a lead-poisoning scare due to a cinnamon additive found in children’s applesauce and Florida governor DeSantis speculates that Trump will declare Iowa caucus stolen if he loses casting doubt about the legitimacy of the result. Finally, readers had strong reactions against our top 10 list of films and TV shows, suggesting alternatives such as &quot;Billions&quot; and &quot;The Holdovers&quot;.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
