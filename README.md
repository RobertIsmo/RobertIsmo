<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been quite a few stories in the news recently about uncomfortable topics. In the US, a jury condemned the gunman who attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue to death following nearly ten hours of deliberation, and survivors and families of those killed expressed a mix of solemnity, gratitude, and relief. In South Africa, an old anti-apartheid chant called &#39;Kill the Boer&#39; has sparked controversy among right-wing commenters who claim it&#39;s a call to anti-white violence; while in Ukraine, troops trained by the West are stumbling in battles as they revert to tactics they know best. 

Here in New York City there&#39;s been a slight uptick in Covid cases, though the numbers are still far below previous waves. And globally, sea ice cover is way behind in Antarctica -- reaching record lows with large implications on our planet&#39;s climate.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump is facing an indictment that accuses him of defrauding his country. It&#39;s shocking stuff and no one has seen an indictment of this magnitude before. Whether you agree with the outcome or not, it&#39;s making headlines around the world.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
