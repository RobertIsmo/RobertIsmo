<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a surge of Covid cases in China, which scientists are trying to estimate without reliable data from the government. In NY, there is uncertainty around the candidacy of George Santos since he falsified much of his resume. Furthermore, the soccer legend Pelé passed away at 82. The US House is considering what action to take about Santos&#39; untruthfulness. There was an unprecedented winter storm in Buffalo NY which caused immense damage and a Russian missile barrage severely damaged Ukraine&#39;s air defense. In California Southwest Airlines has been struggling from the impact of the winter storm and is trying to resume operations with minimal disruptions on Friday.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
