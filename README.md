<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of drama playing out between Russia and Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine last year, and both countries have been at odds since then. The West is supporting Ukraine in this conflict, and the Biden administration recently announced new measures targeting Moscow and its supporters. There are also other international stories unfolding that are worth paying attention to, like protests and demonstrations being held around the world, and even an intense legal battle taking place in Ohio over a train derailment. Closer to home, there have been some unexpected weather events like snowfall in Southern California and an elusive alligator spotted at Prospect Park in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
