<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of international news at the moment! The US has accused the Chinese military of using surveillance balloons to collect electronic communications over more than 40 countries. This is leading to tension between the two superpowers. In the US, Mike Pence has been subpoenaed as part of an investigation into the attack on the Capitol on January 6th, and there&#39;s controversy around the College Board&#39;s African American Studies course. Meanwhile, there&#39;s been a devastating earthquake in Turkey that has killed more than 20,000 people and destroyed much of the area. Finally, composer Burt Bacharach recently passed away at 94 years old; he is remembered for his collaborations with Hal David in creating some of the most iconic songs of the 1960s.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
