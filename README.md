<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Russia, their main mercenary group, Wagner, is without a leader and facing an uncertain future. Meanwhile, in Europe, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been vocal in his support of Putin, which some people are worried could bolster pro-Putin sentiment at a time when Ukraine is trying to counterbalance them. The US military is embracing artificial intelligence and the idea of &quot;robot wingmen&quot; in combat. Closer to home, there was a shooting near Jacksonville recently which has raised questions about racism. They&#39;re trying to find ways to keep the schools open during COVID while improving air quality, and the Trump Organization put up this huge clock on Fifth Avenue without applying for a permit or paying a fee and nobody noticed.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
