<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few big things happening in the world right now. First, tensions between the US and China are high, and President Biden is hoping some high-level diplomacy will help bring them down. Second, NATO might be welcoming Sweden into its ranks soon, which would project unity among the nations involved. Third, a lot of extreme weather events have been happening in the US lately: floods, heat waves, and storms. And finally, there&#39;s been an ongoing investigation into the finances of Hunter Biden that recently hit some snags.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
