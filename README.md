<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now a lot is going on in the US! Governor DeSantis is facing a lot of criticism for his proposed new Black History standards for middle schoolers. Companies specializing in artificial intelligence like Amazon, Google and Meta are making deals with the Biden administration to establish guidelines, but there&#39;s still a way to go before rules for the technology are set. Meanwhile Donald Trump and allies may soon face legal repercussions from an investigation into election interference in Georgia. On a former note, Michael Cohen has reached a settlement with the Trump organization over unpaid legal fees. A judge who was appointed by Trump is taking her time to start the documents trial against him in 2024. 

The world lost an icon this week as well - Tony Bennett, crooner of the American Songbook, passed away at the age of 96. His duets with Lady Gaga earned them both new fame and recognition; in addition, Tony will still always have a home in New York City. President Biden has made some exciting nominations lately as well - Admiral Lisa Franchetti would be the first woman to lead the Navy if confirmed, and William J. Burns will become part of the Cabinet as Director of the CIA - noteworthy for combating Russian invasions of Ukraine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
