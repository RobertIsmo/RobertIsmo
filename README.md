<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of news stories are happening across the world.  In the business sector, the pandemic pause on student loan payments is ending soon, but a new system of calculating repayments may potentially lower monthly bills.  In the US, the Supreme Court is going to consider taking away guns from people subject to restraining orders for domestic abuse. There&#39;s also a decision against affirmative action in college admissions that could have a wide-ranging effect. Temperature-wise, outrageous heat is expected in Texas and places along the Gulf of Mexico while smoke from Canadian wildfires can be seen lingering in the Northeast and Midwest. And in Brazil, ex-President Jair Bolsonaro is facing electoral fraud charges and has been blocked from office until 2030.  Over in France, continue clashes happened between protesters and police with crowds chanting “we don’t forget, we don’t forgive”. Elsewhere in TV and movies, there&#39;s been a surge of content focusing on young people navigating through apocalyptic events. Finally, there&#39;s some hope from the Opinion section as Supreme Court overturns decades of precedents and programs to help students.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
