<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In Ukraine, the military is facing a lot of challenges as they fight to keep their territory safe. The U.S. territory of Guam makes abortion legal but very hard to access and Suriname is feeling the strains of being caught between two big countries in the US-China rivalry. Meanwhile, in the US, residents near Manhattan are struggling to save a well-known, old church from being torn down and replaced with condos. Cancer treatments are becoming increasingly difficult due to drug shortages, while there is some hope for those in the housing market. Intensifying storms have created hidden flood risks across the US and Goodreads has enabled book review-bombing which can tank books before they are even published. Finally, young people in Martinique Copenhagen are finding freedom in bike life and runners can break world records with help from wavelights.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
