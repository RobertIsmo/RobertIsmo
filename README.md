<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The United States recently reached a deal with Iran to free 5 American detainees for money and release of various Iranians jailed in the US. The historic banyan tree in Lahaina, Hawaii was scarred from recent fires but still standing. Donald Trump and his former aide have both pled not guilty to new charges related to documents case. Inflation has gone up slightly, but other details indicate that the price pressure is still moderating. There&#39;s also a bizarre defamation case involving a wealthy teenager suing a 5-star hotel for turning him away from the bar. On the international stage, Russia is replicating Iranian drones and using them to attack Ukraine, while an Ecuadorian presidential candidate was assassinated during a rally last week. Hip-hop music is celebrating its 50th anniversary, while Republicans are trying to stop Donald Trump from running again in 2024 by making him sign loyalty pledges at the Iowa State Fair. It&#39;s clear that Donald Trump&#39;s era has replaced Ronald Reagan&#39;s coalition of &quot;three-legged stool&quot; and changed the state of today&#39;s Republican Party.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
