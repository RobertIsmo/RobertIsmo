<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot of political upheaval going on right now. Representative George Santos of New York has been indicted on several federal charges and Republican Leaders are standing behind him despite the indictment. On a different note, former President Trump is accusing E. Jean Carroll of lying and a judge had to caution him on social media posts. There is also some news coming out related to immigration and the US-Mexico border. The US warned migrants before the pandemic restrictions end that the border is not open and Mexico allowed tens of thousands of migrants to travel to the US border. In addition, there&#39;s some positive news happening in health-related fields too. The FDA is considering allowing over-the-counter birth control pill sales in the US and they say that the benefits of it outweigh the risks. There&#39;s also a pancreatic cancer vaccine that may have staved off returning cancer in half of those who received it in a small trial, but more research needs to be done. Finally, Beyoncé is returning to the stage with her first solo tour in seven years with a spectacular Renaissance performance.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
