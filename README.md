<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of political and economic issues happening around the world. In the US, there is a snag in a debt limit negotiation between the White House and Republicans, while some anti-Ukraine members of the Republican party are pushing for more influence. Over in Georgia, tensions have flared as Russia recently started direct flights to the country and their actions have stirred up fears because they invaded Georgia in 2008. There&#39;s also been tension over the death of Jordan Neely in Harlem, who was choked by police earlier this month, which has sparked more calls for equal justice.

In China, there is a massive youth unemployment problem and their tech giants are signaling a slow recovery from the pandemic. Meanwhile, G7 countries are emulating some of China&#39;s economic tactics to counter it. One interesting move is from &#39;No Labels&#39;, an American organization that is raising money for a third-party presidential run in 2024 that has Joe Manchin at the top of its list. Lastly, Tim Scott is getting ready to join the 2024 race with plenty of campaign cash backing him up.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
