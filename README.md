<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension between the US and China, with the US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen criticizing China&#39;s treatment of US companies during her visit in Beijing. John Kerry is visiting China to restart negotiations on climate change, as the world is facing record-breaking heat due to global warming and emissions from cargo ships. Meanwhile, President Biden is considering giving Ukraine weapons that many US allies have banned because of their potential high risk of causing injuries to civilians. There is also an ongoing mystery surrounding Russian mercenary boss Yevgeniy Prigozhin, as the leader of Belarus said he&#39;d taken him in only to later say he was in St. Petersburg and then &quot;maybe he went to Moscow&quot;. On the health front, there&#39;s a new Alzheimer&#39;s drug called Leqembi that has been made widely accessible by federal decisions and it comes with a black-box warning about safety risks, although Medicare will cover most of its high cost. Lastly, two firefighters tragically lost their lives in a blaze due to them being ill-equipped to face it at Newark Port.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
