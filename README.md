<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on in the world right now. In the US, families from Sandy Hook are trying to hold Alex Jones accountable for lying about the tragedy and taking legal action against him. Voters in rural Oregon are pushing for their own state, and President Trump is suggesting that he may soon be facing an indictment. In Japan, strawberry farmers are using kerosene to keep their crops growing and fruiting out of season. Meanwhile, Iraq is finally a more open country after 20 years since the US invasion but is still hobbled by corruption and a lack of safety for its citizens. Some people are worried about banks as a whole due to their inherent complexities while Russia is continuing to take Ukrainian children even though it has been exposed as an international criminal. In sports news, Kansas, who were the reigning champions lost during the round of 16 while Princeton came out on top. Lastly, there&#39;s fascinating stories like an interview with actor Roy Kent and advice on high intensity interval training that you could check out as well.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
