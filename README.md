<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey friend! It&#39;s been a really busy couple of weeks in the news. On the world stage, Russia is taking advantage of the fragmented West by not being isolated. There&#39;s also discord in Russia&#39;s military as the leader of Wagner disagrees with the senior command. Ukraine uses attack drones on occupied Mariupol to suggest they have longer range weapons than previously thought. In South Carolina, a prominent lawyer named Alex Murdaugh is on trial for murdering his wife and son. In Ohio, a preliminary report from an investigation into an Amtrak derailment suggests an alarm went off before it happened due to an overheating wheel bearing. There are billions of dollars for wind and solar projects in the U.S., but there aren&#39;t enough resources to plug them in. Singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 20 years for child sex crimes, and Elizabeth Koch (the daughter of Charles Koch) has a new venture called Perception Box. There have been tons of stories coming out since Covid started 3 years ago, but it feels like we still don&#39;t know how to talk about it. Heat pumps are becoming more popular which is leading to misunderstanding and misinformation. Finally, snowstorms have knocked out power for 900k customers and California is bracing for a rare blizzard this weekend. Wow! What a week!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
