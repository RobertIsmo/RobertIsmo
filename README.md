<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like politics in the US is creating a lot of drama! There&#39;s a lot of political strife among Republicans, discussion of a former president&#39;s post-presidency peak, and multiple FBI investigations. On the international front, there was a devastating missile strike in Ukraine, while Venezuelan migrants continue to try and enter the US despite deportation efforts. Finally, there are some changes to real estate brokerages which could affect agents belonging to the National Association of Realtors.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
