<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot is going on in the world right now! President Biden and Trump are both vying for the support of auto workers, and the Supreme Court recently made a decision about an Alabama voting map. There&#39;s a GOP debate coming up soon, and polls show that Americans aren&#39;t too keen on Biden, although his party is doing well in special elections. Trump is also raising some questions by expressing interest in buying a gun in store. In other news, Russia is trying to hold military control of the Black Sea, and energy agencies have said that peak oil is near. As far as businesses go, there&#39;s one company in Ohio still making solar panels that Biden wants more of, and truck stops are upgrading to recharge electric vehicles. London has some expensive free parks for people to enjoy when the weather is nice. And finally, two big universities in New York seem untouchable thanks to giant tax breaks, with some people now suggesting they pay more taxes given the city&#39;s tight budget.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
