<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of political upheaval happening across the world right now. In China, tensions with Russia are interfering with Beijing&#39;s attempts to revive its economy. Meanwhile, Putin’s move on nuclear treaty and Russian shelling in Ukraine are calling into question the future of formal arms control. 

Here in the US, the former president, Trump, has spent 10 million dollars from his PAC on legal bills while a school and artist fight over murals of slavery in Vermont. On top of that, a special grand jury in Georgia may be indicting Trump and a coast-to-coast winter storm is affecting millions across America. To top it all off, New York is experiencing record warm winter weather which has caused some snow businesses to suffer. 

Finally, there&#39;s an article about Ian Fishback, a decorated soldier who was whistle-blowing against torture but was eventually undone by his own mind and failed health care system. </p>

<h3>China’s Courtship of European Powers Hits a Russian Wall</h3>

<p>Beijing, in urgent need of reviving its economy, wants to mend ties with Europe but is struggling to create distance between itself and Moscow.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Z5tkqK"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Putin’s Move on Nuclear Treaty May Signal End to Formal Arms Control</h3>
<sub>By David E. Sanger</sub>
<p>Mutual inspections were interrupted by the pandemic, then by the war in Ukraine. But now New START, the last nuclear agreement between Russia and the United States, is dying, and arms control may be, too.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3xNU8jz"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>In Vermont, a School and Artist Fight Over Murals of Slavery</h3>
<sub>By Jenna Russell</sub>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
