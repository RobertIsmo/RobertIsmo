<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things going on in the world right now. In the business world, autoworkers have secured some great wins in new contracts with carmakers over the past few weeks. Meanwhile, people are still debating over the implications of President Biden&#39;s age due to previous comments made by Donald Trump before he left office. On a lighter note, Donald Trump is still ahead in the polls in Iowa and back in Colorado there&#39;s a trial to determine whether he violated the 14th Amendment. In technology news, Google&#39;s CEO gave evidence in an antitrust case against them while X introduced a new valuation system for their stocks. Over in New York, there&#39;s an incredibly detailed map of neighborhoods that shows how locals view their location and culture. To cap it off, Matthew Perry from &#39;Friends&#39; has passed away and authorities are still trying to uncover his cause of death - although it could be a while until we find out.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
