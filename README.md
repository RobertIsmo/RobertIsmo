<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 felonies, including covering up a potential sex scandal during the 2016 election. In Wisconsin, Janet Protasiewicz won a race for the state Supreme Court, which will likely be a victory for abortion rights backers. In Chicago, Brandon Johnson was elected Mayor after running against a tough-on-crime opponent. Additionally, a new analysis of decades of research shows that moderate drinking has no health benefits. In terms of international news, French President Macron has indicated that he hopes China can help to make peace in Ukraine. Also, Finland recently joined NATO as the alliance&#39;s 31st member due to the war in Ukraine, representing a strategic setback for Russia. Lastly, companies are now able to create short videos based on just a few words with advances in A.I. technology.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
