<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are currently wildfires in Hawaii that have been contained but the death toll could rise as search efforts continue. Meanwhile, a city in Maui called Lahaina was devastated by fire, as some survivors reported getting no evacuation orders. On a different note, the US Supreme Court paused a settlement with Sacklers regarding opioid-related lawsuits. The court is reviewing it. 
In other news, there&#39;s an informal agreement between Iran and the US which might help contain Iran&#39;s nuclear program. Special counsel has proposed a date for Trump&#39;s trial regarding his alleged election interference next year. Additionally, two law professors suggested that the 14th Amendment could prevent Trump from holding government office.
A teenager in Manhattan is being sued for defamation after he apparently caused a false campaign to sully the reputation of a 5-star hotel bar. Ecuador is reeling from a candidate&#39;s assassination and Spain just reached its first Women&#39;s World Cup semifinal match. In more sports news, England&#39;s Lauren James received a 2-game suspension at the World Cup. Lastly, Russian Geran-2 drones, replicas of Iranian Shahed-136 drones, are being used to attack Ukraine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
