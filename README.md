<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are huge demographic shifts happening around the world that could drastically reshape countries that have long relied on large workforces. In NY, there has been an arrest made in a decade old series of killings that oddly matches characteristics predicted in 2011. Ukraine is facing a deadly conflict with an abundance of Russian land mines. There are also new developments in Belarus that point to the presence of Wagner forces. Back in the US, Biden has released the remainder of Kennedy-related files but there are still many redacted items. Flash flooding in Philadelphia suburbs over the weekend caused several deaths. Firefighters in Phoenix are working hard to protect citizens from dangerous heat waves. Over in England, the nation&#39;s health service is seeing one of its worst crises since its founding 75 years ago. In sports news, Carlos Alcaraz pulled off an incredible comeback against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon as Djokovic experiences his first loss in 10 years at the All England Club. As concerns over climate change rise, designer&#39;s increasingly seek ways to create homes that can survive natural disasters. Finally, renowned singer and actress Jane Birkin passed away at 76 years old, leaving behind an impressive legacy and her name being immortalized for the widely famous Hermès Birkin bag.</p>

<h3>In Gilgo Beach Killings, an Arrest Bears Out a Decade-Old Prediction</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
