<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is going on in the world right now. In the Middle East, China is looking to broker peace in Gaza while antisemitism is surging online. Additionally, Israel&#39;s Arab Bedouins have been attacked by Hamas and racial tensions are high between progressive Democrats and their primary challengers over their stances on Israel. 

In the U.S., former vice president Mike Pence was unable to escape the &quot;devil&#39;s bargain&quot; of Donald Trump&#39;s 2016 campaign. In Maine, a sheriff just revealed he sent out a statewide alert about a gunman last month before the mass shooting occurred. There are also sustained highs in illegal border crossings due to shifting U.S. policies and global migration patterns. 

In arts news, Matthew Perry from ‘Friends’ passed away at 54 and he wrote an addiction memoir before he died. In the workplace, companies are offering lessons in democracy to address rising distrust attendant with events all around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
