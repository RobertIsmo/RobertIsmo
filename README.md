<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of newsworthy events in the world lately. We have been tracking Hurricane Hilary&#39;s path and precipitation forecasts. In the US, Ron DeSantis received a lot of attention for his transformative transformation after attending Ivy League schools. In sports, Spain won the World Cup, and England almost clinched it but in the end, ran out of luck. Girls in Spain were especially inspired after their team&#39;s success. Similarly, Russia had a failed mission when its lunar lander crashed into the moon. On the political front, Republican presidential candidates are starting to ramp up their campaigns as Biden enjoys strong support from many voters. Meanwhile in Ukraine, their military forces are younger and more offense-minded than those from Russia due to recent NATO shipments of F-16 fighter jets from Denmark and Netherlands in addition to local support from President Volodymyr Zelensky. Lastly, Maui just had a raging fire which led to shifts in the way they manage water resources here in the United States.</p>

<h3>How G.O.P. Views of Biden Are Helping Trump in the Republican Primary</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
