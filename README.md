<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of international news lately. In Europe, the war in Ukraine is continuing and causing a shift of power to countries with negative views of Russia. NATO and the US have agreed to send tanks to Ukraine as part of their defense, but it&#39;s unclear if they will arrive at the right time. Meanwhile, there has been tragedy on US soil. There was a mass shooting of farmworkers in Half Moon Bay and a prominent lawyer is on trial for allegedly murdering his wife and son. Also, G.O.P. State lawmakers are introducing a growing wave of anti-transgender bills. On top of that, New York is trying to expand composting citywide to reduce trash and rodent problems. It&#39;s been an interesting start to 2021!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
