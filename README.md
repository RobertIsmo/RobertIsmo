<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to update you on a few things that have been going on in the world. First, businesses are trying to decide whether to embrace or ban the use of AI-generated essays for college admissions. This is leading to ethical debates over whether it should be allowed. Also, in the US, hiring has settled into a lower gear due to the pandemic lockdowns, and many workers in Hollywood have been affected by recent strikes. There&#39;s also been a lot of news about the conditions faced by some South African renters - living without basic services like water and electricity - as well as staffing concerns at nursing homes. In other news, a Proud Boy member who smashed a window at the Capitol was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and experts are investigating why so many tennis players are getting sick at the US Open.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
