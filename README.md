<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Slovakia, a vote in mid-February could have major consequences for European unity when it comes to Ukraine, and Russia is trying to influence those outcomes. Meanwhile, China&#39;s economic downturn is posing the greatest challenge to President Xi Jinping since he came to power over 10 years ago. 

In the US, the Biden administration is expected to cancel oil drilling leases in an Alaskan wildlife refuge and a Florida bill seeks to make a test featuring Christian thought an alternative to the SAT or ACT. Yale has responded to student activism by making changes to their mental health policies and people are on edge as a convicted killer remains on the run near Philadelphia. 

On the sports scene, tennis players have turned to marshmallows for increased performance success and there have been reports of sexism within Spanish soccer teams, with one player filing a criminal complaint over an unwarranted kiss from the head of their soccer federation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
