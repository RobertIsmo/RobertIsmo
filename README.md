<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot is going on in the world. In the US, Donald Trump is due to appear in court this week as he faces charges over his role in paying hush money to a porn star, while his campaign is preparing for his potential arrest. In Ukraine, they&#39;re gearing up for a critical spring counteroffensive against their opponents equipped with powerful Western weapons. Oil prices have jumped after OPEC announced plans to cut production. And in Louisiana, the LSU Women&#39;s Basketball team has won the NCAA Women&#39;s Title after a big win against Iowa, who were led by basketball star Caitlin Clark.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
