<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is happening in the US right now. In Hawaii, there have been devastating Lahaina fires and it was revealed that none of the 80 warning sirens placed around the island were activated. A group of residents had to make a desperate dash into the sea to escape the fire. Then, in West Maui, people have been stepping up to help their neighbors because of a lack of official aid. There&#39;s also an election interference case being brought before a Grand Jury in Georgia early next week, and Republicans have mixed reactions about the investigation into Hunter Biden, with some supporting it and others criticizing it. Meanwhile, over at the Iowa State Fair we have Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis facing off with Trump maintaining his dominance in Iowa, and Vivek Ramaswamy expressing confidence about his 50% chance of becoming President. Lastly, what&#39;s happening abroad - Russia is threatening retaliation over attacks on a key Crimean bridge and Ukraine is rolling back anti-corruption rules and turning to people once seen as relics of an anything-goes era in order to procure weapons.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
