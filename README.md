<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some really concerning incidents happening in the US lately. There was a video of police officers brutally beating a man, and even though an investigation was launched some of them are still suspended and the outcome is unknown. There have also been mass shootings in California, which has sparked further discussions of gun control regulation laws.

On the international scale, Russia and Ukraine are in talks around the Donbas region in Eastern Ukraine. Israelis and Palestinians are also highly divided in the aftermath of two shootings over the weekend, which caused numberous fatalities on both sides. 

In a more positive light, people may be able to travel abroad out of China soon. There&#39;s also been some innovative housing solutions popping up in the US that&#39;s taking into consideration senior citizens&#39; needs. To cap off, Novak Djokovic won the Australian Open this week amid unusual circumstances due to Covid, while Tom Verlaine passed away at 73; he was a songwriter whose music influenced generations.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
