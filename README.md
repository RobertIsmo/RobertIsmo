<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, the Supreme Court has issued a stay preserving the availability of abortion pills, while virtual clinics are at risk of lower court rulings. There was also an incident involving an Airman charged with leaking classified documents, while Republican 2024 Hopefuls have embraced gun politics at NRA meetings. On top of that, President Biden revealed he planned to announce his own campaign for the 2024 election &quot;relatively soon&quot;. Meanwhile, Donald Trump&#39;s financial disclosure showed lower-than-expected values on his social media company and other such loans. Lastly, a tech executive was stabbed and left to &#39;slowly die&#39;, leading tech leaders to blame San Francisco until an arrest was made. Whew!</p>

<h3>Supreme Court Briefly Preserves Broad Availability of Abortion Pill</h3>
<sub>By Adam Liptak</sub>
<p>The temporary stay is meant to preserve the status quo while the justices study lower court rulings, and it did not forecast how they would ultimately rule.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3mB6byW"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Virtual Clinics Have Been a Fast-Growing Method of Abortion. That Could Change.</h3>

<p>So far, most telemedicine providers seem undaunted by court rulings that could imperil their business.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3MMqAfe"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Airman Charged in Leak of Classified Documents</h3>
<sub>By Michael Crowley</sub>
<p>Jack Teixeira, 21, was granted a top-secret security clearance in 2021, which was required for his job, the Justice Department complaint said.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43DklQW"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Teixeira’s case is unusual even in the small world of leak cases.</h3>
<sub>By Charlie Savage</sub>
<p>Based on the charging documents, Airman Jack Teixeira does not appear to have been acting as a foreign agent, differentiating him from classic spying cases. He also does not appear to have been acting as a whistle-blower.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43vXRB3"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Mike Pompeo Says He Won’t Run for President in 2024</h3>

<h3>Republican 2024 Hopefuls Embrace Gun Politics at N.R.A. Meeting</h3>

<p>The current and potential 2024 presidential candidates showed strong support for gun owners’ rights — a core issue for the party’s base, but one that can be a tougher sell in a general election.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ofrEh8"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Tech Leaders Blamed San Francisco for Bob Lee’s Killing. Then Came the Arrest.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
