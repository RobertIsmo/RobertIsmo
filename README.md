<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the world is facing a multitude of issues right now. On the US front, former vice president Mike Pence has reached a fork in the road where he is trying to persuade voters but also send a warning. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has been indicted and Republicans in Michigan are facing charges for false elector schemes. On the climate side, Republicans are against attempts to cut pollution and are planning more drilling and less clean energy. And unfortunately, Russia isn&#39;t doing much better. Opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny was sentenced to 19 years in jail for supporting &#39;extremism&#39;. 
On the housing market, mortgage rates are climbing so people are buying homes and bragging about their rates. Lastly, prosecutors in New York identified human remains found back in 2011 remarkably near Gilgo Beach which belonged to Karen Vergata who had disappeared in 1996.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
