<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of changes in the world lately—especially in the tech industry. Tech companies have been cutting jobs at an alarming rate, with even Google&#39;s parent company Alphabet trimming their workforce by 6 percent. On the other side of things, Google&#39;s two founders have been coming out of retirement to lead an Artificial Intelligence project with over 20 projects in the works. 

In politics, the US just announced that it&#39;s labeling a mercenary group called Wagner as a transnational criminal organization which will make it much more difficult for them to do business. On top of that, there is a growing movement against abortion rights and people are pushing for stricter regulations in this area. 

Worldwide, New Zealand&#39;s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern just stepped down because she said she no longer had &#39;enough in the tank&#39; to do the job properly. This news came just after Ardern maneuvered through one crisis after another but had less success confronting persistent challenges that were hobbled by previous governments. It&#39;s definitely not an easy time for many countries so we should try to lend our support as best we can.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
