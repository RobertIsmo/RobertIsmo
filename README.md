<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some interesting developments happening around the world. In the US, firms have been producing and supplying shells for artillery to help Ukraine in their efforts of defending themselves against Russian aggression. Meanwhile, Washington and Manila are working together to establish a stronger presence for the US in the Philippines, there are discussions of raising the nation’s debt ceiling, and house representatives recently ousted Ilhan Omar from a foreign affairs panel. 

In the business world, mortgage rates have hit five month lows which is encouraging home buyers to return to the market, people are buying chickens instead of puppies due to an uptick in egg prices, and a tech company is soaring by adding an additional $100 billion in value. 

On an international level, Brazil is planning to sink a decommissioned navy vessel rather than dismantle it due to asbestos concerns, sturgeon populations are under threat in North American rivers which is shaking up traditional conservation efforts, and Pope Francis has been invoking enthusiasm with his trip around Africa. While all that&#39;s happening, Beyoncé may make Grammy history this weekend with her new album “Lemonade”.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
