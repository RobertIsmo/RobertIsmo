<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, Donald Trump is facing multiple charges related to false statements he made about the 2020 election results, and supporters of Florida Governor DeSantis have released memos about debate strategies. Meanwhile, a Texas woman has been charged with threats against a judge presiding over Trump&#39;s election case. Elsewhere, search efforts continue for human remains in Maui after a wildfire, and there&#39;s a shortage of school bus drivers making it difficult to get students to class. In the business world, people are becoming increasingly interested in Colorado mountain towns due to its remote-worker-friendly lifestyle, and Wall Street analysts are bullish on the housing market right now. Finally, Ukraine is building legal evidence to prosecute Russia for ecocide as dead dolphins wash up on shore in the Black Sea.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
