<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, soldiers are struggling with the psychological trauma of a long-running war. Markets are tumbling as fears spread throughout the global banking sector and several key banks have seen their stocks slide. Goldamn Sachs is reportedly getting ready to receive a large payout from a Silicon Valley Bank deal. Technology companies are producing more sophisticated Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, but they aren&#39;t perfect yet. A century ago, Thomas Midgley Jr. inventor was behind two destructive innovations that still have effects today. In New York, exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui has been charged with a financial conspiracy. NASA has recently unveiled a new moon suit for Artemis astronauts made in collaboration with Axiom Space. In Texas, a closely watched case about abortion pills will soon go before a judge in court. Lastly, a yacht broker named George Santos helped facilitate a private $19 million yacht sale between two of his largest donors just before his congressional election - which poses questions about the mix of politics and personal interests in his case.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
