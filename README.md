<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In terms of politics, Russia, China, and Iran are supporting the Palestinian group Hamas in a worldwide war of words. On the business front, Fox News has been getting positive reviews from Jewish viewers for its unflinching support of Israel in its fight against Hamas. With markets, job growth slowed and policymakers have had to reassess their expectations of interest rates and the economy. In exciting news, there are many seniors who are choosing to retire down south in Florida. Lastly, there has been some controversy surrounding Eric Adams, mayor of New York City as the FBI raided one of his aides&#39;s home over possible corruption questions. Meanwhile, in science and tech development, GM&#39;s Cruise self-driving cars have been facing scrutiny around the company&#39;s response to regulators and CEO&#39;s expansion plans.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
