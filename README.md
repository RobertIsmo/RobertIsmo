<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like it&#39;s been a pretty busy week in the news! On the world front, China and Russia are strengthening their relationship following a high-profile meeting between their leaders. Over in Europe, officials have agreed to increase the supply of artillery shells to Ukraine. Closer to home, former US president Donald Trump is facing potential criminal charges and his lawyers are trying to block the investigation into election interference in 2020. We&#39;re also having worrying climate news with a new UN report predicting that early 2030s marks a critical threshold for global warming. To tackle this, a new pipeline project is being discussed across the Midwest which raises both climate and property rights concerns. The worst part is that people are still unsure about what actions to take and how to fix things. On a lighter note, an athlete is finally speaking out about the sexual abuse she experienced from her coach several years ago and Iraq recently marked its 20th anniversary of US-led invasion – with terrible consequences for America.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
