<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
2020 was an emotionally draining year for many people around the world. There was a lot of political turmoil in the US, with the Supreme Court ruling to disqualify former President Donald Trump from office. Congress was also incredibly dysfunctional--they managed to pass only 27 bills into law despite holding more than 700 votes. In Yemen, Houthi militia have increased their influence through ship attacks in the Red Sea. 

Meanwhile, people in Ukraine were struggling to cope with a war against Russia while in the US, people faced astronomically high rents and record levels of homelessness. Pope Francis even changed Church laws to allow priests to bless same-sex couples. Finally, photographers have captured powerful images of war and grief that highlighted 2020&#39;s heavier moments.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
