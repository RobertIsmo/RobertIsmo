<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the news is filled with political and business issues happening around the world. Ukrainian President Zelensky recently called for more international support for his nation and punishment of Russia at a United Nations meeting. Meanwhile, the White House is discussing a defense treaty model with Saudi Arabia, which may be an incentive for it to normalize its relationship with Israel. Canada recently made an unexpected claim against India concerning separatist groups, while Justin Trudeau accuses Indian agents of being involved in the killing of a Sikh leader in Canada. Closer to home, Pennsylvania has started automatic voter registration and a special election is underway in Pittsburgh to determine which party will control the state House. Finally, there&#39;s some labor news - autoworkers are going on strike, potentially affecting the overall labor movement.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
