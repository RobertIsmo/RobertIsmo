<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is turmoil around the world right now, especially at the U.S. southern border. The Trump administration had made it extremely difficult for asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants to enter the United States, resulting in the deportation of thousands of people and terrible criminal violence towards those who remain in Mexico. Closer to home, police brutality is coming under increased scrutiny after the death of an unarmed homeless man by a chokehold in New York City&#39;s subway system. Meanwhile, there is hope in the form of ‘mommunes’, which are communities of single mothers banding together to help one another financially and with parenting tasks. In other news, the United States is facing a severe cash shortage, there are concerns about weapons ending up on the black market due to inadequate military control and security, and former President Trump continues to avoid accountability for a variety of issues related to his presidency.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
