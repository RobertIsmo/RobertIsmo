<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the U.S., former President Trump has been using fear and favor to win Republican endorsements, and in an election year there has been an atmosphere of intimidation for public officials. Meanwhile, overseas, there have been deadly bombings in Iran claimed by Islamic State, and Iraq has condemned the U.S. after a drone strike in Baghdad. Also in the U.S., Harvard&#39;s first Black president recently resigned, and an investigation into the January 6th riot at the Capitol is ongoing with hundreds of people sentenced to prison sentences. There is also evidence that Trump received millions from foreign governments while in office, and he is trying to get prosecutors held in contempt for taking new steps in a court case after it was put on hold. In the art world, there&#39;s a trial coming up where an oligarch is accusing Sotheby&#39;s of helping an art dealer trick him into overspending for works, and here in New York City, we are suing bus companies who were part of a plan to send tens of thousands of migrants from Texas here. Finally, a controversial Drag Queen event forced a library to close without ever even happening!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
