<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of different things happening around the world. In the US, Justice Alito has been defending his luxurious private jet travel expenses for a fishing trip, and a closer look at a submersible lost in the North Atlantic has revealed cramped conditions with only one view port. To make matters worse, when President Biden welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India last week, he pushed democracy concerns to the background. On the other hand, Modi is trying to reach out to people by employing an old-fashioned radio show in India which has helped boost his popularity. At the United Nations he celebrated yoga and encouraged inclusivity. Meanwhile, back in the US, student loan payments are restarting with consequences for the economy and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell declared there&#39;s still a &#39;long way to go&#39; in the battle against inflation. And in an interesting sidenote - Magazine reported that The Simpsons writer was part of something called &quot;The Dark Side of The Rainbow&quot; when Pink Floyd music was played over The Wizard of Oz movie - weird! On a less lighthearted note, there have been several stories about bad mishaps on boats in the Mediterranean sea - with lives lost due to crowded conditions and migrants thrown into the sea without any hope of a better life. Thankfully, a superyacht did come to the rescue and help save some lives in what is one of the region&#39;s worst wrecks in decades. It&#39;s certainly a difficult time for many but we can hope that awareness will bring relief soon.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
