<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of unrest in the world right now. In Russia, there have been questions raised about sanctions after Western technology goods have been found in Russian missiles. An American was recently detained in Moscow and appeared in court for the first time after being arrested last month. Meanwhile, top diplomats discussed policies on Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine and China&#39;s assertiveness. Mexico has become the biggest user of a very controversial spy tool called Pegasus despite promising to stop using it. On the domestic front, there is an upcoming possible debt crisis in the US that Wall Street isn&#39;t paying much attention to yet, and a 16-year-old was reportedly shot by a man who still hasn&#39;t been arrested. There was also a murder in upstate New York involving a person who wandered into the wrong driveway. Lastly, there has been news about Sudan with reports of chaos, as well as an ex-boyband member alleging he was raped by the father of the Menendez brothers.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
