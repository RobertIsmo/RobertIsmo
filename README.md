<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot happening in the world. In the US, there is an investigation into a &#39;Scorpion Unit&#39; in Memphis that was previously praised by city leaders for fighting crime, but may have been flawed from the start. There is also a case involving Tyre Nichols where officers gave him 71 commands in 13 minutes which proved to be impossible orders and major questions arise on whether his death was preventable and the consequences of his beating. In response to the influx of gun violence in California, lawmakers are calling for more regulations. In international news, Israel launched a drone attack on an Iranian facility and Russians and Ukrainians are fighting for control of villages near a key city. Additionally, there have been developments in senior housing and travel with granny flats popping up across countries and China dropping restrictions on overseas journeys. Finally, there is discussion on the health dangers of gas-burning ranges as industry scientist Julie Goodman&#39;s toxicology work raises questions about the science behind them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
