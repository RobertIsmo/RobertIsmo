<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I just read about a lot of things going on in the world, from politics to sports to business. In the US, President Biden is facing a big decision about the debt limit because of a bill passed by Republicans. The US economy is growing slowly but inflation is still high. 

In other news, Carolyn Bryant Donham, whose testimony led to the acquittal of two men accused of murdering Emmett Till in 1955, has died. An airman was accused of leaking government secrets and had a history of making racist and violent remarks. Judy Blume&#39;s coming-of-age novel is being made into a movie soon. 

Also, there is a lot of financial stress because owners and lenders are haggling over real estate debts. In New York, officials failed to address the housing crisis so now they have to figure out what to do next. At Fox News, one anchor was let go after offensive private messages he sent were found. Meanwhile, an alternative conservative cable news channel called Newsmax has been getting more viewers since he left. 

In sports news, basketball star Brittney Griner spoke out against Russia for detaining people wrongfully while the US imposed sanctions against Russia&#39;s intelligence agency and Iran&#39;s intelligence services for similarly detaining Americans.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
