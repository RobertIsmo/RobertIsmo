<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are pretty chaotic right now. In the US, the Biden administration proposed a rule that would allow schools to block some transgender athletes from competing on sports teams, and in Tennessee the GOP retaliated against 2 Democratic lawmakers by trying to kick them out of the House. Around the world, there are heightened tensions between Israel and Lebanon after a rocket barrage and reports of sabotage on several pipelines near Russia that remain unsolved. Business-wise, there&#39;s some concern over wages possibly causing inflation and instability, but then also news about A.I. and DNA being used to unlock supply chain mysteries.</p>

<h3>Suspicions Multiply as Nord Stream Sabotage Remains Unsolved</h3>

<h3>Biden Plan Allows Limits on Trans Athletes’ Participation in School Sports</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
