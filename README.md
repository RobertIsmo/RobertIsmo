<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the political world. Kamala Harris is trying to reclaim momentum in the 2024 campaign and Donald Trump is calling for a judge&#39;s recusal as his lawyer deems efforts to overturn the election &#39;aspirational&#39;. Ron DeSantis is also amping up retail campaign politics in Iowa. In international news, Vladimir Putin is trying to lead Russians into a civilizational conflict with the West and Ukrainian forces have fired drones at Moscow. On the technology front, facial recognition technology has wrongfully accused someone of a crime. Movies are still being released, such as Barbie which just reached $1 billion at the box office, while athletes like Megan Rapinoe and Alessia Russo are making headlines. Creative writers in China are also looking for ways to capture hidden everyday realities, and murders have become so rare due to improved technology. Lastly, there&#39;s a fight over dune shacks in Cape Cod that have been cared for by locals, activists, and artists.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
