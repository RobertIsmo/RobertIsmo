<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! First, there is a landmark Supreme Court ruling which some people want to be overturned, as it protects the news media from paying a steeper price for mistakes. This is linked to Fox News and their settlement with the election technology company Dominion. 

In other news, the US Supreme Court has delayed its decision on the abortion pill, meaning access to the drug will remain widely available. At the same time, two separate shootings in different parts of the country occurred after minor missteps on everyday tasks, bringing attention to self-defense laws across the country. 

We&#39;re also seeing a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, due to Russian propaganda, and US Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III is pushing for Sweden to become part of NATO.

Finally, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is in a fight with Disney World over an agreement they have and his potential Republican rivals are attacking him. In addition to that, there is also a cease-fire in Sudan making it difficult for civilians to use as an escape route.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
