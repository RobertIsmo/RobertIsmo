<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is lots of political tension across the US right now, as some Red states have become even more conservative and Blue ones more progressive. In Oregon, one party has actively brought Senate proceedings to a standstill with a boycott. India also had a deadly train crash recently and is now dealing with the tragedy of it; investigation efforts are underway to figure out exactly why it happened. On the opposite side of things, Russia has started incorporating a lot of patriotism and army-glorifying education into their schools, while Nigeria is struggling to determine who owns certain pieces in its museums. In terms of sports, some NBA players like Nikola Jokic are introducing their own joyous kind of play to the courts. And lastly, there was a surprise Sonic Boom in the DC area caused by military jets that responded to an airspace intrusion.</p>

<h3>Money for Show Horses, Not Work Horses, on India’s Rails</h3>

<h3>In Russian Schools, It’s Recite Your ABC’s and ‘Love Your Army’</h3>
<sub>By Neil MacFarquhar and Milana Mazaeva</sub>
<p>The curriculum for young Russians is increasingly emphasizing patriotism and the heroism of Moscow’s army, while demonizing the West as “gangsters.” One school features a “sniper”-themed math class.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Cbn07M"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>What Happened When a Brooklyn Neighborhood Policed Itself for Five Days</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
