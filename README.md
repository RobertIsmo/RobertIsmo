<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US Supreme Court has rejected an election theory that many feared would have taken away power from people and given it to states. Some big cases are still waiting to be decided by the court, which leans heavily towards a conservative majority. In Russia, there was a failed mutiny against Putin which has other foreign leaders concerned. There&#39;s a new audio clip of former President Trump that appears to contradict his recent claims about having unclassified documents in a meeting. Ivanka Trump was just cleared from a New York civil lawsuit, and could mean the same for her father and his company. Fox News managed to beat The Tonight Show in the ratings, likely thanks to Greg Gutfeld&#39;s insult conservatism. There have been a large number of transgender laws passed across the US that tackle things like medical care and restroom access. Studies have also shown higher suicide risks for transgender people. Ryan Seacrest recently became the new host of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. And lastly, there&#39;s a terrifying three-body problem out there which could cause global races for new armaments and ultimately lead to thermonuclear war. On top of all this, parts of the South and Gulf regions are experiencing extreme heatwaves.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
