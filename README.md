<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, families of hostages are deeply worried about what the feared Israeli invasion of Gaza may mean for their loved ones. For those living in Gaza, it is already chaotic as hundreds of thousands flee their homes in northern Gaza. In the US, President Biden is trying to prevent escalation from Israel&#39;s enemies, Iran and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, China has had its economy suffer from a reliance on a borrow-to-build model for decades, and many projects they have used this model for have become debt ridden. Beyond the Middle East and China, there has been a powerful earthquake in Afghanistan that has killed more than 1,000 people in the last week or so. Lastly, while it may not seem relevant at first given all other world events, New Orleans has some of the best dining experiences if you ever get a chance to visit.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
