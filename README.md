<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot happening in the world. In Morocco, a deadly earthquake shook the country, leaving survivors terrified and rubble everywhere. Russia seems to have a new player entering politics- Viktor A. Bout, an arms trafficker who is convicted of his crimes but hopes to make a comeback in politics. Ukraine is pointing the blame on Russia for reports of torture against citizens, while Russia has denied it altogether. 

In the US, there&#39;s a miracle happening in Missouri - people are visiting a nun&#39;s body that hasn&#39;t decomposed 4 years after her death. President Biden is keeping his son Hunter close despite the political ramifications. At Iowa’s biggest football game, Trump and DeSantis went head to head in a clash of politics and sports. Coco Gauff has earned quite the spotlight after winning the U.S. Open singles title and is ready to take on fame even more in-depth than before.

Technology wise, there is development in facial recognition technology from both Facebook and Google - they built tools to idenitify any face and though Silicon Valley tends to not move slowly with releasing things, they&#39;ve held back this time around.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
