<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some significant events happening around the world right now. First, in the Middle East, Israel is preparing to invade Gaza while tensions are rising between the country and Hezbollah. We&#39;re also seeing an uptick in airstrikes and ground fighting between Israelis and Palestinians. Meanwhile, in US news, Republicans are still struggling to elect a new Speaker of the House after removing their primary candidate Jim Jordan from consideration. There&#39;s also been political chaos and frustration as they try to figure out how to move forward. Additionally, we’re seeing a surge in the US deficit which has effectively doubled this year, while legal battles over Donald Trump&#39;s election interference cases are intensifying with the recent guilty plea by a Trump-aligned lawyer. Internationally, South Korea experienced a Halloween tragedy last year that has resulted in little change or punishment for those responsible. Finally, the Supreme Court has lifted limits on Biden officials&#39; contacts with tech platforms related to misinformation and blocked a Missouri law that attempted to override federal gun laws.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
