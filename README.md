<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot is happening in the world right now. To start, there&#39;s a debate among top Democrats about President Biden&#39;s re-election bid, and whether or not it&#39;s something the voters want. In the meantime, former president Trump has criticized a Florida governor for passing an abortion ban, and the US and China are stepping up their global espionage activities. The US and Chinese officials met in Malta to discuss the Ukraine crisis and other pressing issues. There have also been huge protests in New York City against fossil fuels, and people are recognizing the pervasive feeling of dread they feel due to climate change as &#39;eco-anxiety&#39;. Lastly, two people were charged with murder in connection with the death of a one year old at a day care center.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
