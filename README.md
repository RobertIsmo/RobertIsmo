<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot happening in the world. In the US, there are blizzard conditions affecting travel across the Northern and Central Plains. There was also an attack on an Erbil airbase in Iraq injuring three US service members, leading to US strikes against Iran-backed groups. In terms of climate news, Earth was due for another year of record warmth, but this year&#39;s off-the-charts heat is making scientists question whether global warming is accelerating. As for international news, Turkish Parliament has approved Sweden&#39;s NATO bid and Ukraine struck a Russian warship in Occupied Crimea. Russia&#39;s Alexey Navalny has been transferred to an Arctic prison while nearly two million have moved into Gaza&#39;s south as fighting intensifies. New York is also dealing with its own crisis as 150,000 migrants have arrived in less than two years. Finally, a private equity firm buying hospitals appears to have led to more serious medical errors.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
