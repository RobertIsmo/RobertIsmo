<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Many of the news articles that I&#39;ve seen focus on ongoing tensions between Iran and the West, as well as the US presidential election. In Lebanon, a commander in Hezbollah&#39;s Radwan unit was killed in a strike in Southern Lebanon. In America, President Biden is connecting with a different type of evangelical voter than before, and he&#39;s travelling to Charleston for a campaign trip. Meanwhile, Florida&#39;s governor Ron DeSantis will have less influence over this legislative session due to his focus on the presidential primaries. In addition, there was a scary incident on an Alaska Airlines flight that caused part of the plane’s fuselage to blow out mid flight. Finally, this week was also the Golden Globes ceremony; we’ve seen some photos and heard about Lily Gladstone making history and some of the best and worst moments from it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
