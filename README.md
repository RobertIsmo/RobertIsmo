<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a big week in the news lately with former President Donald Trump facing criminal charges in Manhattan, world leaders viewing his political resilience as inevitable, and 7 Democratic senators voting to convict him after the Jan. 6 riots. On a different note, Finland has been named the happiest country on earth for 6 consecutive years and in Russia, a military blogger was killed in an explosion and an American journalist was detained and accused of war crimes. Closer to home, Norfolk Southern’s safety practices are being questioned after worker deaths and derailing in East Palestine, Ohio, and on the political side, Democratic candidates are running on abortion even when they have no actual say on the issue.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
