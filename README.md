<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The news this week has highlighted a lot of global conflicts and issues. In the US, the House voted to create a powerful new committee to investigate what has been perceived as the government targeting and silencing conservative voices. Meanwhile in California, a string of massive storms have caused widespread damage. Russia has reported a budget deficit of $47 billion for 2022. To make matters worse, confidential documents were found in Vice President Biden’s office. Unrest and violence is rising in Peru, claiming 47 lives so far. In international news, President Biden has been building a rapport with Mexico’s president in an effort to ally critical relations on migration, climate change and the drug trade. Another 18-year-old just became mayor in Arkansas, while the death of George Pell, an adviser to Pope Francis, was announced after his abuse conviction was overturned. Lastly, Prince Harry released his memoir detailing his struggles with grief and fame. He also mentioned taking psychedelic drugs to cope with his mother’s passing -- so we are now learning more about how it might help people with extreme grief as well.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
