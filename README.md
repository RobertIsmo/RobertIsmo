<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of important developments happening around the world right now. In the U.S., Michigan Democrats are trying to turn a battleground state blue, while Republicans are facing pushback from efforts to tighten voting laws on college campuses. In New York, there&#39;s controversy over an effort by the governor to force suburban areas to build more housing to help with a housing crisis. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing criticism for sidelining political opponents and more broadly, there&#39;s worry about unchecked power wielded by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, in Israel there&#39;s tension between the U.S. and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over an effort by Netanyahu&#39;s government to overhaul the judiciary system, which U.S. President Biden has sharply criticized. In Ukraine, their steel industry has galvanized a war effort against Russia and here in the U.S., six people were tragically killed in a school shooting in Nashville recently and people around the country are reflecting on how gun violence has impacted their outlook and choices in life. Lastly, a woman in Connecticut has turned to Vermont for help so she can die on her own terms since Connecticut does not allow medical aid in dying, prompting local legislators to make the practice more broadly available.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
