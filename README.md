<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the Federal Reserve is looking into the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while Congress prepares for hearings on the subject. Meanwhile, relief over recent financial rescue measures has pushed stocks up for a second day, with investors expecting decisions from the Fed on interest rates. In other news, Ukraine is under siege, and there&#39;s a push to insure big deposits on Capitol Hill. In the US, there&#39;s been a video released of an immigrant man&#39;s death in custody, as well as speculation about the potential indictment of Donald Trump. People are also talking about Michael Bloomberg spending five million to support Kathy Hochul’s budget plans. Lastly, we&#39;ve seen Google enter the race to make A.I chatbots, and news about tall people not playing basketball in March!</p>

<h3>Push to Insure Big Deposits Percolates on Capitol Hill</h3>

<p>The government insures only deposits of less than $250,000, but there is precedent for lifting that cap amid turmoil. It could happen again.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3JWdpGw"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>‘The Circus Continues’: For Trump, Legal Woes Resurrect Old Habits</h3>

<p>The former president strengthened his political position in recent weeks, but an impetuous response to his potential indictment could alienate voters he will need to win back the White House.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3TDWko3"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
