<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. Tucker Carlson, an influential Fox News host, has been stirring up a wave of white fear in American cable news. Joe Biden is readying himself for a reelection bid, trying to defend his record while warning against the dangers of Donald Trump&#39;s return. Meanwhile, China&#39;s ambassador to France has made some controversial remarks that have angered European leaders. In Ukraine and many other places around the world, there is a renewed hope amidst difficult and dangerous times. Closer to home, there are numerous business stories like Credit Suisse struggling and Don Lemon leaving CNN under scrutiny. We&#39;re also seeing the implications of remote work affecting the next generation of workers, particularly when it comes to supervision, and Dr. Judith Herman&#39;s surprising return to trauma studies after years of silence.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
