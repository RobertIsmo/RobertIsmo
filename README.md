<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of political news happening right now, from US-related topics to international events. In Congress, Republicans have blocked aid to Ukraine even as the country fights against Russia. In the US, four Russian soldiers have been charged with war crimes against an American and the Justice Department is investigating the murder of more than 30 Americans by Hamas fighters during an attack in Israel. Kevin McCarthy announced he would leave Congress at the end of the year and House Republicans are threatening Hunter Biden with contempt charges over his refusal to testify in private, though he&#39;s offered to do so in public. There&#39;s also controversy surrounding college presidents who dodged questions about antisemitism and an unauthorized teach-in supporting Palestinians held by educators in Oakland. On top of that, an airstrike hit Rafah after Israel had urged Gazans to seek safety there and TV industry giant Norman Lear passed away at 101 years old. Finally, there&#39;s a fourth Republican debate happening on Wednesday and there&#39;s a heated race between Haley and DeSantis for No. 2.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
