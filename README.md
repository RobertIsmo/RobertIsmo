<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening right now in the world. In Ukraine, President Zelensky&#39;s party is planning to replace the Defense Minister amidst a growing corruption scandal, but the Defense Minister himself has not been implicated in any wrong-doing. Ukrainians are escaping the war by going to ski resorts nestled in the Carpathian Mountains, allowing people to recuperate from their physical and emotional wounds. 

In terms of US news, there is an incident involving a Chinese spy balloon that has revealed that competition between China and the US is intensifying. On that note, the US navy is currently recovering pieces of debris from the balloon off South Carolina and officials are expecting retaliation from China. President Biden is set to make his first State of the Union address since GOP took control of Congress where he will likely call for bipartisan cooperation, although many people don&#39;t expect this to actually happen. Finally, a network of conservative donors aligning with the Kochs have said that they will back GOP primary candidates—probably in reaction to former President Trump&#39;s loss in 2020. 

The arts world is buzzing about Beyoncé&#39;s potential success at the Grammys this year since she has put out an amazing new album called &quot;Renaissance.&quot; 

In sports news, the Brooklyn Nets have announced that they are trading Kyrie Irving to Dallas Mavericks after he requested to be moved. This move was unsurprisingly controversial given that he recently posted a link to an antisemetic film on his Instagram account. 

On climate change front, there is a new program out there called the Inflation Reduction Act which can help you save money as well as fight against climate change if you make certain changes like renovating your home or buying an electric car. Lastly, Goldman C.E.O David Solomon&#39;s hobby as a DJ has come under scrutiny given that it may lead to potential conflict of interests in his professional life at Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
