<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a turbulent week in the news -- the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O&#39;Connor, passed away. There&#39;s also been a lot of drama surrounding George Santos and his possible expulsion from Congress, as well as questions concerning his personal finances and campaign fund-raising. In addition, Israel had detailed knowledge of a Hamas attack plan over year ago, which brought up concerns about security and foreign policy. Meanwhile in the U.S., oil production is hitting record levels but this has raised climate worries -- protests have broken out at a climate summit flagged by the Federal Reserve and OPEC has agreed to cut its own production. Lastly, it was quite a year in movies despite its somber themes, and former statesman Henry Kissinger had quite an impact in current politics until his passing.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
