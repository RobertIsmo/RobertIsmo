<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things have been busy in the news lately! In New York, there is a lawsuit that could unravel former President Trump’s New York empire. There is also a judge who will determine whether he committed fraud and another who denied his request for recusal. 

Moving further away from the US, there have been some interesting developments in foreign relations. Saudi Arabia and Israel have been making strides toward normalizing their relationship by exchanging visits.

Closer to home, there are Republicans in Congress pushing for a government shutdown if a temporary measure to fund it is not secured by September 30th. Other political news includes the House of Representatives voting to strip Trump’s former Defense Secretary of his salary. 

Finally, three Black women have taken it upon themselves to preserve desecrated African American burial grounds and the stories they hold, while other legal issues involve the Peace Corps practices of rescinding invitations to applicants on the basis of mental health conditions. El Paso is also feeling the strain of high numbers of migrants seeking asylum there. 

Oh, and did I mention that ABC launched a new dating show featuring a 72-year-old man? He’ll be on the search for love among singles over 60 – so hopefully he and others have better luck than some past bad dates!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
