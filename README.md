<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the GOP in the US has nominated Mike Johnson for speaker of the House following a period of deadlock. In other world news, a Times analysis of a missile video concerning a blast in Gaza found that it didn&#39;t shed light on what happened. An Israeli peace activist named Yocheved Lifshitz who was kidnapped and beaten by Hamas has been released after 17 days in captivity. The past few weeks have seen the deadliest period for Palestinians in the West Bank in 15 years. Michael D. Cohen recently publicly denounced Trump during a court appearance, while former Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis and 3 other lawyers involved with Trump&#39;s attempt to overturn the 2020 election have pleaded guilty in Georgia. Trump is trying to derail the federal case with more motions as well. Meanwhile, actor Richard Roundtree has passed away at 81 and Hurricane Otis is expected to make catastrophic landfall in Mexico early Wednesday morning. And an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot admitted he took psychedelic mushrooms prior to disrupting a flight. Finally, Opinion articles are discussing Palestinian republics of fear and misinformation as well as Britain&#39;s Prime Minister Rishi Sunak&#39;s current outlook.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
