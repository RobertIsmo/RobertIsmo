<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>

There are some really strange and troubling developments in the world right now - from Canadian wildfires sending smoke across the US to a blast that probably breached a Ukrainian dam. And now Chris Christie is entering the 2022 election race, taking on Donald Trump. Meanwhile, there&#39;s an investigation into Trump and his documents that seems to be getting more complex as it goes on. It&#39;s been interesting to watch unfold!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
