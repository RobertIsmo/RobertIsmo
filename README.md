<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. The US is looking at possible criminal charges against former President Trump, including civil rights law violations in voting fraud cases. In New York, a judge refused to move a criminal case against Trump to federal court. Meanwhile, John Kerry, President Biden&#39;s climate envoy, has been talking to China about taking faster action on climate change. A spy in Britain claims that Russian President Putin made a deal with the head of a mercenary group called Wagner LLP. In Alaska, there&#39;s concern over low numbers of King Salmon and whether people should stop eating them. Stanford&#39;s president has resigned after admitting flaws in his research. Student journalists are getting more attention after reports they did about the president of Stanford and head football coach of Northwestern lead to their resignations. Texas is using harsh tactics at its border with Mexico that have some federal agents concerned about more drownings. NYC is discouraging migrants from even coming by telling them there is not a guarantee of finding help here. Lastly, there was recently released Barbie movie, which critics had mixed opinions about whether it was actually subversive or just corporate capitalism at work.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
