<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a looming government shutdown in the US as House and Senate leaders have been unable to agree on spending levels by a Jan. 19 deadline. Former President Donald J. Trump is prominently campaigning in Iowa as the primary there enters its final phase. In Michigan, Republicans are holding a disputed vote to remove their state&#39;s controversial party leader, though her allies are challenging it. In terms of travel safety, Boeing is again coming under scrutiny after their 737 Max aircraft experienced a problem midflight, leaving passengers unsure of what to do. American unions are also making news as some have shifted their views on Israel to ones that are more critical of the country and its politics. In the NFL, playoffs are heating up and scenarios are being mapped out for each team with 18 weeks complete in the regular season. Lastly, people from Texas seeking marijuana are driving fans of cannabis to Sunland Park, New Mexico as it has become something of a &#39;Little Amsterdam&#39;. On Feb 28th, the Golden Globes will be taking place with streaming and other options available for people who might not be able to attend.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
