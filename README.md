<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. The US is gearing up for the upcoming election and President Biden has been polling strong but is running neck-and-neck against former president Donald Trump. On top of that, more Republicans are saying that Trump committed serious federal crimes, while still supporting him. In Ukraine, they&#39;re waging a counteroffensive with drone and missile attacks on Russian soil, to degrade Moscow&#39;s ability to wage war. And in Oregon, they&#39;re battling an opioid crisis by decriminalizing small amounts of illicit drugs. Finally, legendary actor and comedian Paul Reubens passed away at age 70, leaving behind his iconic Pee-wee Herman character.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
