<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. On the business side, bank stocks have been bouncing around as investors readjust their expectations of the economic outlook. In health news, the head of the CDC has resigned and the WHO has declared an end to global Covid emergency. Meanwhile, cases, hospitalizations and deaths from Covid are at some of their lowest levels in years, but the CDC is scaling back its Covid tracking efforts. There has also been a shocking subway killing that has made New Yorkers--and elected officials--question mental health and public safety.

On other fronts, the video game franchise The Legend of Zelda just released yet another long-awaited entry. In politics, the college president of Bard College has been defending himself after Epstein money was revealed in some of his donations. And closer to home, a conspiracy theory emerged that targetedTrump&#39;s potential rival - Florida governor Ron DeSantis - linking him with conspiracist groups calling him a &#39;tool of the Deep State&#39;. But it looks like his popularity with these groups may seeing a downturn.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
