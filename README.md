<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the UK, sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were put in place -- but some reports of generous exemptions and overreaching by officials have come up. Meanwhile, Russian president Vladimir Putin has been at a summit in Africa trying to boost his country&#39;s image by providing free grain to African countries. 

In the US, recently there was an affirmative action ruling that is shaking up universities and their admissions practices beyond race. On the labor front, public sector jobs are sitting empty, so unions are getting involved with recruitment efforts, and in Congress they&#39;ve accused the Health Secretary of failing to protect exploited migrant children. 

And in terms of news in the US involving political leaders, Vice President Biden has made attacking legacy admission policies at Harvard a political winner, while Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had an episode freezing midsentence during a news conference which raised questions about his health and future. Finally, Sinead O&#39;Connor made waves when she appeared on Saturday Night Live and tore up a photo of the Pope -- but what many didn&#39;t remember was that her performance beforehand was just as powerful.</p>

<h3>Life Under U.K. Sanctions: Chauffeurs, Chefs and $1 Million Allowances</h3>
<sub>By Jane Bradley</sub>
<p>Despite tough talk, Britain’s new sanctions program against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has proved shaky. Some oligarchs have received generous exemptions. Officials have at times overreached.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3OxYmFw"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>How Big Is the Legacy Boost at Elite Colleges?</h3>

<h3>Biden’s Fight With Harvard Is a Political Winner and Policy ‘Band-Aid’</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
