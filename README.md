<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there&#39;s a lot going on in the US and abroad. President Trump and Ron DeSantis are clashing over key policy issues leading up to the election in November. Elon Musk had an event with DeSantis, which ended up exposing the weaknesses of Twitter. In Florida, the Governor&#39;s wife Casey DeSantis is getting involved in major state projects, and looking to join her husband on the presidential trail. Overseas, Russian warplanes are using old bombs that nearly impossible to shoot down in Ukraine, while their success at Bakhmut could mean a tougher war for Ukraine. Finally, police violence against Black people has caused massive psychological strain over the past three years since George Floyd&#39;s murder. From a business perspective, China&#39;s housing crisis is a symbol of excess growth as too many apartments have been built compared to population size.  And when it comes to kids learning how to read, schools and educators may need convincing when it comes to changing up traditional practices even with a country-wide effort. Lastly, Reid Hoffman, a billionaire Silicon Valley investor who co-founded LinkedIn is taking on A.I projects that look to improve humanity.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
