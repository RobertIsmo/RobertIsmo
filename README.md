<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, former President Donald Trump&#39;s lawyers have been trying to overturn the 2020 election results while one of his lawyers, Jenna Ellis, recently pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in a racketeering case. In Israel, they are taking steps to put an end to Hamas, but who will govern Gaza once they&#39;re done? An 85-year-old woman held hostage in Gaza spoke out about her ordeal, and Israel&#39;s plan for entering Gaza could cause some of the fiercest urban combat since WWII. In Ukraine, young people have been particularly hard hit by the war, and evacuation orders have recently been issued for children from villages near the front line. Meanwhile, in Canada, they&#39;ve had a devastating year of fires that burned 45 million acres and caused endless evacuations and smoke.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
