<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of political drama going on in the United States. The Republican speaker of the House of Representatives recently reached across the aisle to Democrats in order to pass a bill that avoided a government shutdown, which prompted one far-right congressman to threaten to try and remove him from his role. Elsewhere, Ukraine is currently expressing confidence that the US will still support them against Russia, even though Congress didn&#39;t include money for them in its stopgap funding bill. Other countries are also dealing with tense situations - like in Niger, where Russian flags have become a hot new trend. Closer to home here in the US, there&#39;s been a rise in private security guards to protect struggling downtowns and the Supreme Court is about to face a challenging docket when it re-opens.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
