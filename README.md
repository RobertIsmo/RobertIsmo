<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
At the moment, there are a few major news stories happening around the world. In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states have sued Amazon for conducting business practices that stifle competition. Robert Menendez is facing a growing push from a number of Democrats in his own party to resign after his recent indictment. The Supreme Court has declined to revisit a matter concerning Alabama&#39;s voting map, and Donald Trump raised legal questions when he requested to buy a Glock from a gun store during his trial. 

On an international scale, an explosion at a fuel depot in Nagorno-Karabakh has resulted in at least 125 deaths. It is not known yet what caused the blast in this breakaway region of Azerbaijan where people have been fleeing for Armenia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
