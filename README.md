<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there is a campaign against transgender rights which has mobilized conservative groups. Across the country, states are banning gender-affirming care for minors. In Sudan, there is widespread fighting between different factions of the military, threatening a planned civilian-led democracy. In Ukraine, some soldiers are donating sperm to ensure that their partners can build families, even if they die in the war. Meanwhile, Brussels is crying foul at Poland and Hungary for banning Ukraine grain imports. Elsewhere, Christians gathered in Kyiv to celebrate Orthodox Easter despite the shadow of war. And finally, Fox News is on trial in Delaware for spreading false information about the 2020 Presidential election, while Eliud Kipchoge will be running his first Boston Marathon this Monday - he holds the world record for 26.2 miles!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
