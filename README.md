<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a pretty intense week in the news. Kevin McCarthy needs votes to stay Speaker of the House, and Matt Gaetz is challenging him over allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of funds. In the meantime, the Justice Department has enlisted thousands of undocumented migrants in their efforts to stop smuggling across US borders, although many have reportedly been unlawfully held for months on end. Over in China, tech professionals and other elites are fleeing to other countries for better opportunities - although, unfortunately, not all of them are choosing the United States. 

Back in America, Trump has been making some inflammatory statements lately while his followers are furious over his indictments. Elsewhere, experts suggest Russia’s military strategy “elastic defense” may be aiding them in battle. Outside of politics and war news, people are asking questions about insulin resistance and how to deal with it, how Dave Portnoy used Barstool diplomacy to build a pizza empire, and why Michael Lewis isn&#39;t able to make Sam Bankman-Fried into a hero in his new book &#39;Going Infinite&#39;.</p>

<h3>Jailed and Desperate, Immigrants Are Enlisted in Border Crackdown</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
