<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the business sector, investors are worried about the financial stability of California&#39;s Silicon Valley Bank and other similarly sized lenders. On the global stage, Saudi Arabia and Iran recently agreed to re-establish diplomatic ties after talks hosted by China. Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping is cementing his dominance and elevating allies in his new government. Closer to home, prosecutors in Manhattan are signaling that criminal charges may be coming for former President Donald Trump. And when it comes to tackling climate change, some cities, like New York, are relying on surprising solutions like carbon capture for their buildings to reduce air pollution.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
