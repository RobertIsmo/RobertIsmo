<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey! There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world recently that I wanted to bring you up to speed on. 
In the US, Donald Trump was arrested and had his bail set at $200,000 for election interference in Georgia. His preliminary trial date is set for 2026. Additionally, officials from both parties are gearing up for a Republican Presidential debate next week. On the other side of the country, California just narrowly avoided catastrophic damage due to a rare tropical storm. Unfortunately, smoke from numerous wildfires is blanketing the Pacific Northwest with air quality alerts and evacuations throughout the region. Additionally, over 50 buildings have burned in British Columbia due to wildfires. 
On a less serious note, Oliver Anthony Music&#39;s song &quot;Rich Men North of Richmond&quot; unexpectedly reached number 1 on the charts due to viral marketing tactics. Finally, Waymo just started offering its self-driving taxis on Monday in San Francisco for people to pay for and experience first-hand. 
That&#39;s some of what&#39;s been going on in the world lately!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
