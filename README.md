<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there’s a lot going on in the world. In the US, the Justice Department has published its report on their investigation into the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department following George Floyd’s death. Meanwhile, ex-President Donald Trump is facing a federal indictment and Congress is mostly unhappy about it. There have also been multiple tragic events recently, like a jury convicting someone for killing 11 people in a Pittsburgh Synagogue and hundreds of dead migrants from a boat wreck in Greece. Further, there are ongoing fights over female leadership within the Southern Baptist Church, along with various mis&#x2F;disinformation being spread over social media about the Titanic disaster at sea. On another note, Boris Johnson, former Prime Minister of Britain, has resigned and will be writing columns for a tabloid newspaper again. Lastly, there are antiwar messages that are being shared in Russia using symbols like fish and asterisks as a way to oppose their invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
