<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world right now are quite worrying. The conflict between Israel and Gaza has resulted in two American hostages being set free, but it&#39;s unclear how our government is responding to it. In the U.S., people are weary of foreign conflicts and are conflicted about how much involvement our government should have. In Ukraine, there is evidence of rape and torture by Russian forces, while in Jordan, House Republicans are asking what comes next after a hard-line conservative was brought down. On a different note, climate change is also becoming an increasingly pressing issue and has even been affecting psychotherapy methods. Finally, the census categories for race and ethnicity have changed over the past 230 years which has transformed how the nation sees itself.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
