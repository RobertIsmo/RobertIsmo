<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening around the world. In the U.S., Private auditors have failed to detect migrant children working for U.S. suppliers of Oreos, Gerber baby snacks, McDonald’s milk and many other products. There is a record number of unaccompanied children traveling to the U.S. from Central America and other countries have ended up. Columbia has had protests over the Israel-Hamas War and Nikki Haley was asked tough questions about the cause of the Civil War at a town hall in New Hampshire. In China, their property crisis has blown up bets that were considered safe, and South Korea is cracking down on drugs following the death of an actor there. Lastly, in Ukraine, expatriates have chosen to stay despite the war despite millions fleeing and there is a recent development where Russia has retaken some land won by Ukraine during a counteroffensive.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
