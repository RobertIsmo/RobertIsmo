<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the global news is very intense! In Gaza, a hospital is running out of resources and there is increasing rhetoric about erasing Gaza and causing harm to civilians. In the U.S., Biden and Xi Jinping are meeting to discuss climate change, while President Biden faces Speaker Mike Johnson in his first confrontation. Additionally, Trump and his allies are working towards an agenda should he gain a second term. Elsewhere, FIFA&#39;s president has been quietly steering the World Cup to Saudi Arabia. On the brighter side, residents in Kyiv have been experiencing a respite from bombing.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
