<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. First, the U.S. is close to finishing its massive task of destroying chemical weapons, which they&#39;ve been working on for decades. The NATO alliance is encountering some complications in celebrating its latest member—Sweden—owing to Turkey and Hungary&#39;s objections. Ukraine has requested cluster munitions from the U.S., which has caused a controversy due to the weapons being largely banned. Treasury Secretary Yellen will be visiting China soon and will need to address economic issues between both countries. German businesses are panicking over regional risks that are straining their economy&#39;s model, while some famous people (like Tom Brady) have taken a hit from the crypto crash. Many transgender care clinics are struggling due to 20 states passing laws against them, while social media platforms are at a crossroads in deciding how best to combat fake news without infringing upon free speech. Finally, there is a massive transit grant on the way for a Hudson tunnel project, as well as a search warrant for former President Trump&#39;s residence and club being fully revealed, and Instagram debuting their &#39;Twitter Killer&#39;.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
