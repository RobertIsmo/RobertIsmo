<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Hunter Biden&#39;s plea deal has fallen apart due to external pressures and Donald Trump recently skipped the G.O.P. debate and held his own counter-programming event instead. There&#39;s also Hurricane Hilary threatening Mexico and California, causing heavy rains and flooding. In Palm Springs, residents are bracing for Hilary’s downpour and maps are being made to track it. Meanwhile in Brazil, experts are faced with the tricky challenge of finding two isolated members of the Piripkura people. Closer to home, Hawaiian Electric was warned of its system&#39;s fragility before a wildfire broke out and in British Columbia there is currently a state of emergency due to the wildfire there. To top it all off, Gen Z is stepping up with TikToks and lawsuits to finally take on climate change. It&#39;s definitely been an intense couple of weeks!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
