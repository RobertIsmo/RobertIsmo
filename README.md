<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some really interesting things happening in the world. In Ukraine, there are American-led volunteers who have access to weapons but are not allowed on the battlefield. There&#39;s a battle going on in Bakhmut, too, leading to a humanitarian crisis. The largest isolated tribe in the Amazon is facing death due to illegal mines. Ecuador tried and failed to protect their Amazon rainforest by not drilling for oil and has had to consider expanding drilling now due to crippling debt. Israel is trying to weaken their judiciary system, and geothermal power is stuck in limbo in Japan because powerful local interests want to keep their hot spring resorts safe. Donald Trump is still strongly campaigning for the 2024 election and more guns are being stolen from parked cars. In sports news, South Carolina is chasing an undefeated season and Chris Dailey has been a support system for Geno at UConn for 38 years.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
