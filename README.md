<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like the world is facing a lot right now. In the US, there is news about using masks, especially N95 masks, to protect against coronavirus and wildfire smoke. There is also news on a former CNN executive&#39;s turbulent time running the network lasting 1 year, a dam breach in Ukraine causing flooding in villages downstream, and then a presidential documents case in Florida with Taylor Budowich appearing before the grand jury. On a more positive note, Saudi Arabia has apparently had a success that transcends sports recently. 

In regards to sports, Rory McIlroy supports the proposed merger between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour, while openly expressing his lingering opposition to LIV Golf. There is also news of the Colorado River in crisis due to climate change and overuse affecting the Grand Canyon. 

In terms of politics, Mike Pence announced his 2024 candidacy in a video this week, while North Dakota&#39;s Governor Doug Burgum has also thrown his name into the presidential hat.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
