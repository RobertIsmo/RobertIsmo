<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In the US, there&#39;s a lot of controversy surrounding Harvard President Claudine Gay and her answers to questions about antisemitism. There&#39;s also been a lot of debate over whether anti-Zionism equates to antisemitism. In Israel, there have been intense Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7th, leaving the town Kfar Aza devastated and raising concerns for Israel&#39;s future. Gazans are being forced to seek shelter in areas that are shrinking rapidly and in danger due to ongoing Israeli operations. In Maine, military scientists and the army are looking into whether or not Robert Card&#39;s psychological collapse could be linked to brain damage from when he was a grenade instructor. On top of this climate change has been a huge topic with a global climate summit taking place and a seven question quiz about climate news being released. Lastly, there is also a pop-up market outside one of New York City&#39;s biggest migrant shelters at Randall’s Island Athletic Field 83.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
