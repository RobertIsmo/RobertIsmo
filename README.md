<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Russia, President Putin has been attempting to consolidate power and gain control of Ukraine, but he&#39;s faced several setbacks. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken believes China is considering providing Russia with weapons, which would damage the already strained relationship between the two countries. 

In the U.S., former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley is trying to make a bid for the Republican presidential nomination and will be facing tests about sexism and identity politics in her party. The Michigan GOP has also installed an election denier as their leader despite having lost their bid last year, showing an increasingly strong takeover by Trump loyalists. 

On a lighter note, we&#39;ve seen some beautiful images come out of southern Carolina after a Chinese spy balloon was recovered there. An investigation into whether or not a painting was done by Charles Peale at the beginning of the Revolutionary War revealed some interesting art historical connections. 

Finally, British schools seem to be grappling with sexism being spread by popular online personalities, while former President Jimmy Carter is opting for hospice care after reaching 98 years old.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
