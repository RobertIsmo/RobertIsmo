<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Former US President Donald Trump was just found guilty of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll, a case tested by a jury. He&#39;s been ordered to pay $5 million in damages as a result. Meanwhile, Congressman George Santos is facing federal criminal charges for lying on the campaign trail and engaging in questionable financial activities.  In terms of international news, President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy just had a meeting with no consensus being reached on the debt ceiling and spending cuts, while Vladimir Putin is attempting to justify Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine during a scaled-down ceremony celebrating the Soviet Union&#39;s victory in World War II. Also, Chinese foreign minister is visiting European countries, and we recently heard that a journalist was killed in Ukraine due to rocket fire. Lastly, Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson announced he will be starting a new show on Twitter, presumably following an amicable separation from the network.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
