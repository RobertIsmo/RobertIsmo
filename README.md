<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of important developments in the news. Just in the US, there&#39;s a legal investigation into Donald Trump&#39;s potential involvement in a felony as well as an ongoing discussion about the implications of putting a stop to TikTok. Additionally, Virginia authorities have released a video showing the death of a man at their custody in March and Florida governor DeSantis has been raising questions about the character of former President Trump. In terms of economics, small and midsize banks are trying to keep depositors from panicking while questions arise about the Fed having sufficient oversight on the banking sector. International news includes China and Russia forming a stronger economic partnership, despite issues with Ukraine, as well as Japan winning the World Baseball Classic with Shohei Ohtani being heralded as its star player. Finally, there&#39;s been an important scientific finding from new research that came out of Wuhan: it turns out samples taken from a local market had traces of covid-19 and raccoon dog genetic material in them.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
