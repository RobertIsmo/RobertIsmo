<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, there&#39;s a lot going on. In Ukraine, a deadly strike targeted Russians and has exposed their military failings. Meanwhile, in Romania, U.S. troops are training near Russia&#39;s war in an attempt to send a signal to Moscow. Back on the home front in the U.S., the Jan. 6 transcript transcripts have been released from the Capitol riots and participants are being tried for their respective roles. In sports news, a Bills player collapsed during an N.F.L game and athletes and fans nationwide have been offering up prayers in his name for recovery; he had been determined to give back to his Pennsylvania hometown before his medical emergency occurred. In politics, Republican Kevin McCarthy is trying to become the Speaker of the House, but is facing opposition from hard-right representatives, who could be replaced by an alternative challenger should McCarthy ultimately fail in his bid for power. On the international front, Brazilian authorities are reviving a fraud case against George Santos that had previously went cold due to law enforcement officials not being able to locate him; while stateside, law enforcement officials are attempting to determine if a heavily armed man caused a panic at a supermarket broke law. Lastly, concluding on educational news, U.S. News &amp; World Report is changing its school ranking system following boycotts from numerous law schools nationwide.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
