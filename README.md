<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like India is now becoming the most populous country in the world, surpassing China. This could lead to big changes in the global economy, since India has a much younger work force that&#39;s expanding while China&#39;s age and contracts. On top of this, China&#39;s shrinking population is a potential problem that could lead to serious implications for everyone around the world. Meanwhile, Fox News recently settled with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million over broadcasting false claims about the 2020 election. In other news, access to abortion pills could be limited as a case involving them moves through the Supreme Court. Also, an Attic Greek cup seized from a museum is at the center of investigations and debates about its restoration. Lastly, there&#39;ve been a few military and civilian tensions around the world—in Sudan two generals dinner together before turning on each other resulting in an unresolved conflict; and a similar issue happened in Kansas City when an 84-year old shooter mistakenly shot and killed a woman who had accidentally ended up in his driveway.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
