<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news this week. Economists are worried about the economic toll of even flirting with a US default as Congress and the White House negotiate a deal. Ukrainian President Zelensky asked for more aid from the G7 nations; meanwhile G7 nations are wrangling over ambitious climate commitments, with the US caught between defending Biden&#39;s climate change agenda and aiding allies. In Ukraine&#39;s war with Russia, Ukraine pressed ahead this month with military maneuvers to gain ground in the strategic city of Bakhmut. In Florida, Air DeSantis is taking private jets around the country to prepare for a presidential run and his expenses are being paid by a Michigan nonprofit who won&#39;t say where they got the money. British novelist Martin Amis recently passed away leaving behind classic bleakly comic novels like &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;The Information&quot;. Meanwhile, economists are trying to figure out why inflation is so stubborn—partly because of cars. Also in sports, Jim Brown demands that people see more than strong athletic performances from him. The e-sports world is also teetering with teams in America&#39;s most prominent league selling their teams—suggesting an uncertain future. Finally, people from Hawaii have been increasingly moving to Las Vegas and the reason why is unclear since there is no ocean in sight.</p>

<h3>Martin Amis, Acclaimed Author of Bleakly Comic Novels, Dies at 73</h3>
<sub>By Dwight Garner</sub>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
