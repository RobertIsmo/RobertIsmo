<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the Biden Administration is facing a court battle over their communications when it comes to the 1st Amendment on Social Media. In addition, there&#39;s an ongoing dispute in China between corporate America and their desire to stay or leave. Back home, a former White House Chief of Staff has been denied the ability to move one of his racketeering cases to Federal Court from a state court and an investigation to connect Trump to the Capitol Riots continues. And not far away, a Tennessee man and his mother associated with the riots were sentenced to terms in prison. Even Elon Musk made news by refusing to aid a Ukrainian drone attack on Russia through his Starlink Satellite Network. Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi defied predictions by announcing she&#39;ll seek re-election for her Congressional seat in 2024 among the 19 other veteran Representatives who are still currently in office. To add even more tension on the topic, college enrolees have become decreasingly male leading many colleges to adopt an unofficial policy: Affirmative Action for men. Taking it even further into controversial territory, the Supreme Court is now being asked to hear an Abortion Pill case that could have future implications surrounding terminating pregnancies while Florida Supreme Court is considering if their traditional legal principle extends abortion rights in regards to its constitutional privacy rights.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
