<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is facing a lot of political tensions right now. In the US, there has been headlines about gun rights, Trump&#39;s legal fees and threats from him against Republicans who don&#39;t agree with him. Meanwhile, in Russia and Ukraine there has been drones attacking cities and tensions between the two countries are high, as well as further developments in games like Minecraft spreading propaganda from Russia. And even in places like the Middle East and North Carolina, leaders are making decisions that could drastically affect democracy. It&#39;s a lot to take in and definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
