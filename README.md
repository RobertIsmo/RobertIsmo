<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of contentious issues related to politics and social rights are coming up. In the US, two young Black lawmakers were recently expelled from the Tennessee legislature and there&#39;s momentum to reappoint them directly back to their seats. Also, the Supreme Court Justice Thomas recently revealed he was advised not to report some lavish gifts he received, but has since decided to comply with new guidelines. Meanwhile, the US Justice Department is facing challenges in pursuing lawsuits against former President Trump simultaneously and documents containing national security secrets were released online. On a different note, electric car revolution is being advocated by the E.P.A. with government scientists putting together new rules related to tailpipe regulations. On the health front, a Texas judge ruled against the federal approval of abortion pill mifepristone, which was however soon overturned by another judge from Washington State. Lastly, studies have concluded that abortions through pills are safe regardless of where they occur.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
