<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In Israel, lawmakers are voting on a plan that would limit the power of their Supreme Court. This has caused a rift over the country&#39;s identity and future. In the US, President Biden has warned Prime Minister Netanyahu against pursuing the same plan, while former Republican aides are helping whistle-blowers through Congress. 
Ukrainian families are seeking full honors to bury their dead in cemeteries similar to Arlington National Cemetery. A study of elite college admissions data in the US suggests that being very rich is its own qualification. Meanwhile, Florida Governor DeSantis is facing a reboot and reckoning with his campaign after facing missteps and cost issues. Soccer fans are rallying around Norway&#39;s national federation leader Lise Klaveness, who has been outspoken about FIFA&#39;s failures. Finally, people across the globe are looking for new workouts this year to stay fit and healthy despite the pandemic shutting down some prestigious theater stages.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
