<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are a bit hectic right now. The US government announced that it will allow nearly 500,000 Venezuelan migrants to work in the country legally. In Texas, local and federal authorities are struggling to respond to an influx of border crossings. In the Senate, Tommy Tuberville has been blocking military promotions but that could be sidestepped soon. Attorney General Merrick Garland is facing some Republican efforts to drag up details around Hunter Biden&#39;s investigations and he&#39;s not amused. Meanwhile, newly-appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Q. Brown Jr. is making his way through the Senate confirmation process and likely to make it past Tuberville&#39;s blockade. Hunter Biden is due for court next week, although his lawyer says he will plead not guilty on three gun charges. On the national level, President Biden is caught in between allies Canada and India following Canada&#39;s accusation of assassination against India. In the international arena, Sikhs and Hindus are even further divided as a result of this news. And finally, Google&#39;s new chatbot has just gotten more powerful but is still erratic, and OpenAI released a new version of its DALL-E image generator as well as incorporating it into their ChatGPT chatbot.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
