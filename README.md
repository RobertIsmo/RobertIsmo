<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there is a lot going on in the world right now. Technology wise, Fox News has had to pay out an expensive settlement and make embarrassing disclosures after they broadcast false claims. There are also some legal cases against them, like libel and a discriminatory work environment. In US news, Susie Wiles helped a Governor get elected in Florida but he counter-acted by banning her from his circle; Donald Trump then offered her a spot in his team. Meanwhile, an Atlanta prosecutor has requested to remove a lawyer from the Trump case where ten Georgia Republicans have been trying to reverse the 2020 Presidential elections results. A tragic event recently occurred in Kansas City where a teenage boy was shot after mistakenly ringing a doorbell at the wrong house; further in New York, new details have emerged about a deadly shooting of another young woman after driving up the wrong driveway. Additionally, a Russian court rejected an appeal from a Wall Street Journal reporter who was detained for espionage accusations. The Pentagon is currently closely examining their procedures for handling classified information since it was recently revealed that an Air National Guard posted secrets online. Lastly, the Ukrainian and Russian presidents visited the military line between them where there has been fighting, trapping families in their homes with limited resources.  On Netflix&#39;s side too, they announced they&#39;re ending their DVD service even though they owe some of their success to it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
