<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now, especially in the business and economics sectors. The US economy has grown in the first quarter, and inflation remains high despite some changes in what is driving it. Elsewhere, the controversy surrounding Fox News has deepened with the discovery of offensive texts sent by Tucker Carlson, while an airman who is accused of leaking confidential information has a history of making racist and violent remarks. 

Away from politics and economics, tech tycoon Elon Musk is ramping up efforts in artificial intelligence as he warns against its dangers. In Ukraine, Soledar is a small town that has been widely affected by conflict, but its salt is a proud symbol of national identity. Moving over to entertainment news, Jerry Springer - host of the raucous and often confrontational talk show - has passed away at 79 years old. A further 7 landmark copyright cases are being heard with Ed Sheeran at the center of it all. Looking to fashion, Anna Wintour paid tribute to iconic designer Karl Lagerfeld and explored how his clothes have played an important part in her life.

Finally, this year&#39;s Met Gala will be focused on the 2023 theme with a variety of guests expected, while the upcoming NFL draft will look to change its tone amid criticism of its fascination with players’ bodies and tragic family histories.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
