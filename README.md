<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on in the world lately. In the US, we had a ferocious fire in Maui that caused many fatalities and injured survivors have been flown to Honolulu for treatment. We also had a whole legal saga related to former President Donald Trump, with lawyers saying he would be facing potential jail time for his behavior if he was an ordinary citizen. Now, some of those election deniers are facing their own consequences as well. On the technology side, researchers are desperately searching for chips and AI-related tools called GPUs to power artificial intelligence products. Google is testing an AI assistant which will offer life advice. Also, Russia is threatening ships in the Black Sea, so a 40-mile channel in Romania has become a secure route allowing Ukrainian grain to travel under a NATO umbrella. Lastly, there&#39;s growing concern over &#39;forever chemicals&#39; found everywhere in our food, drinks, and products and what they could be doing to our health. The IRS has also received an $80 billion infusion to help improve customer service but they still need future funding uncertain for now.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
