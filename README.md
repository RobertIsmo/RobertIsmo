<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is in a state of flux right now. In Russia, there have been reports that the government is sending low-level recruits and convicts to fight in eastern Ukraine, and President Putin has used the 80th anniversary of victory at Stalingrad to effectively justify the invasion. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky has been cracking down on corruption - possibly in preparation for E.U. accession talks - as China engages in suspicious activities like sending balloons over the northwest U.S., and the U.S. is attempting to deter China with a larger military presence in the Philippines. There&#39;s also some big news in tech; after years of expansion and generous spending, tech giants are now scaling back, and Meta has seen a huge surge in its market value, adding $100 billion to its worth. Lastly, climate change continues to be an issue, as Brazil plans to sink an old asbestos-filled aircraft carrier to prevent it from docking elsewhere. And back home, we&#39;re bracing for extreme wintry temperatures and thousands of people in Texas are facing extended power outages due to a deadly ice storm. Oh, and former Trump executive Allen Weisselberg might be facing fraud charges soon, too!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
