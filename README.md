<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, in the US, there is a live vote count underway to decide who will become House Speaker. There is a divide among Republicans with some supporting Representative Kevin McCarthy and others blocking his nomination. 

On the sports front, there was an emergency response at a NFL game when a player&#39;s heart stopped. He&#39;s improving now and the recordings have been released of the medical personnel&#39;s response. 

In Idaho, there was a tragic murder of four college students, and an affidavit has been released detailing what happened that night. A timeline has also been released of the suspects movements that night. 

Elsewhere in the world, Benedict&#39;s funeral took place, bringing an end to an extraordinary period for the modern church. However, not all were content with Francis&#39; homily for Benedict and believed it was too modest for their standard-bearer. 

Finally, in California, there is a powerful storm moving across the state. It is bringing heavy rain and high winds which have led to evacuation orders along the coast and near swollen rivers. This storm is expected to last for several days.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
