<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to give a quick update on what&#39;s been happening in the world lately. In the US, there is chaos in the House due to infighting within the Republican Party over who should be the next Speaker. There has also been a lot of controversy regarding the legitimacy of the 2020 election results. Additionally, Hurricane Otis has formed and has quickly become a Category 5 storm, catching many by surprise. In Gaza, there&#39;s been a lot of violence due to Israeli bombardment and conditions are becoming increasingly dire. Finally, there are some legal proceedings taking place involving Sam Bankman-Fried and a fraud case and Fani Willis in Georgia with an apparent racketeering case.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
