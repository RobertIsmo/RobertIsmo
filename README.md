<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of labor disputes in the US this summer, with unions and companies negotiating contracts and sometimes threatening strikes. Internationally, there&#39;s been news about political shake-ups and military conflict in Ukraine. The US sent weapons to Ukraine that were linked to the deaths of 3 Americans in Iraq. There have also been conflicts over water rights in Minnesota, and a scandal over gerrymandering in Los Angeles. Finally, Florida was ruled to have violated the Voting Rights Act by creating an illegal congressional map. In Hawaii, there has been some confusion over evacuation alerts due to a faulty wireless alert system.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
