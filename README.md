<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. The US is sending their M1 Abrams battle tank to Ukraine as Russian forces gain control in the Eastern region of the country. Meanwhile states in the US are being met with an escalation of shootings, with civilians sometimes putting their bodies on the line to protect one another. There is also an upcoming big and unusual election for a Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin with big policy stakes for the state. On the health front, there are legal challenges to state bans on abortion pills and in other parts of the world, people are struggling to feed their children due to rising inflation. Technology has also become a bigger issue as companies try to access more of your personal information through your email address. Lastly, scientists are seeing strange activity around Jupiter&#39;s volcanic moon Io and fake online reviews have become a huge issue for people traveling.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
