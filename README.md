<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a number of events happening around the world right now. One of the most recent news stories is the death of Henry Kissinger, a Cold War statesman who played a major role in international relations with China, Russia, and the Middle East. His legacy is still being felt in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and elsewhere. In Israel, there&#39;s currently a war going on between Hamas and the country. There&#39;s been a backlash from some progressives against Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for not calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. In the United States, federal prosecutors have indicted an Indian official in connection with an attempted assassination plot in New York City while President Biden&#39;s administration has proposed replacing nine million lead pipes across the country over the course of 10 years. Finally, airlines around the world are racing to make jet fuel from corn as part of their efforts to fight global warming.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
