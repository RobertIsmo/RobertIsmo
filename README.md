<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, we shot down a high-altitude object over Alaska and the FBI found one classified document after searching Vice President Mike Pence&#39;s home. On the global front, China is trying to play down a spy balloon incident and Russia is firing missile barrages at Ukraine as combat intensifies. In Turkey, rescue teams are responding to an earthquake and volunteers are piecing together a makeshift medical system in the disaster zone. Lastly, Senator Fetterman is recovering from a stroke and adapting to life in the Senate with help from Congress.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
