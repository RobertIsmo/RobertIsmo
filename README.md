<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on in the world right now! The United States is isolated from its allies regarding the conflict in Gaza because of different positions on how to handle the situation. The UN voted to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, but did not call for a suspension of hostilities. The Supreme Court has declined to hear a case on President Trump&#39;s immunity defense for now. Court rulings are being made across the country regarding the will of the voters and rule of law when it comes to approving Trump&#39;s candidacy. Meanwhile, Apple is considering deals with news publishers to train its generative AI systems on their articles, and Brexiters are being disappointed by the number of immigrants coming from outside Europe. Lastly, truckers are facing a parking crisis in America due to a shortage of spots nationally which leads to unsafe situations on the roads.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
