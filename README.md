<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hi there, 

It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Donald Trump is facing a criminal indictment on classified document handling, and Southern Baptists are voting on strict bans against women in leadership positions. On top of that, the U.N. is trying to cross a front line in Ukraine to inspect a nuclear plant, and the C.I.A. has warned Ukraine not to attack any pipelines there. Inflation has cooled down somewhat recently, but people have still been spending quite a bit in revenge spending following the pandemic&#39;s restrictions. Doctors are now using chatbots to improve their bedside manner with patients, and apparently thousands of Indian women have been abandoned overseas by their husbands. Lastly, New York City food writers have compiled dozens of recommendations for summer eats! 

That&#39;s what I know so far - hope it helps you stay updated on the news!</p>

<h3>Trump Ordered Not to Discuss Case With His Aide and Co-Defendant</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
