<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hello! There is a lot happening around the world right now. In Ohio, there&#39;s an election coming up on Tuesday which could potentially amend the state&#39;s constitution related to abortion. In New York, Governor Cuomo&#39;s sister has been working with grassroots activists to help discredit his accusers. Meanwhile, Florida Governor DeSantis has publicly acknowledged Trump&#39;s 2020 defeat for the first time in an interview with NBC News. In other political news, federal prosecutors are asking for a protective order in a case relating to the Jan. 6 insurrection, and President Trump&#39;s countersuit against his accuser E. Jean Carroll was thrown out by a judge.

There have also unfortunately been deaths related to racism recently in the US, such as the killing of Native American man Raymond Mattia at the hands of border patrol agents outside his home in Arizona. To offer contrast, dancer and choreographer O&#39;Shae Sibley&#39;s killing at a Brooklyn gas station serves as a stark reminder of how important expression can be--even when it is seen as threatening.

In terms of global economics, borrowing money is more expensive right now due to higher interest rates, and some projects in offshore wind farms have been running into delays and cost issues raising concerns about whether they can play their part in tackling climate change. Even cryptocurrencies were grabbing headlines with schemes like OpenAI leader Sam Altman&#39;s &#39;Worldcoin&#39; that would scan billions of human irises. And lastly, summer camps are increasingly looking more closely at the mental health needs of kids they care for as America grapples with a mental-health crisis.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
