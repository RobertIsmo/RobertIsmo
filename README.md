<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to tell you some of the news stories I&#39;ve been reading lately. It looks like former President Trump and his allies have gone to great lengths in trying to reverse the result of the election in Georgia, and a grand jury may decide soon if he should be indicted for interfering. In the US, there are impediments to switching over to renewable energy sources, and a wildfire on Maui in Hawaii has caused major devastation—the water system collapsed, churches have lost their buildings, and families are still searching for missing relatives. Plus, there&#39;s an ongoing case involving an FBI spy hunter with some shady activities. Moving overseas, there was an interesting discussion with Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard about his life rules, and some Middle Eastern countries have banned a movie called &#39;Barbie&#39;, but it&#39;s oddly becoming popular in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
