<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, newly elected President Biden is trying to call for bipartisan cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, but many don&#39;t expect it to happen. Meanwhile, a conservative donor network is stepping up to back GOP primary candidates with an aim to oust former President Trump. Elsewhere, the Navy and Coast Guard have been sent to recover debris from a Chinese spy balloon that drifted across the US for 7 days. In response, China has registered “strong discontent and protest” but ultimately may not be able to retaliate against this incident.

In other news, violence in the occupied West Bank appears to be on the rise and Israeli settlers see this as an opportunity for their cause. And in China, there is still much uncertainty about the real death toll from Covid-19 as dozens of obituaries from China&#39;s top academics seem to suggest an enormous loss. Despite this, consumer spending has started to pick up in China after “zero Covid” restrictions were lifted and people are beginning to visit ski resorts in Ukraine for respite from the war.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
