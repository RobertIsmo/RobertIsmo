<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of changes going on in the world right now when it comes to business and finance. A risky bet on crypto currency caused a run on deposits at Signature Bank, so regulators decided to close the 24-year-old institution because it could threaten the financial system&#39;s stability. Also, HSBC is buying up Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s British subsidiary, and there was some uncertainty recently regarding a possible new bank panic. There are also developments in other countries such as Russia, where wealthy Russians can build a new life without having to cut ties to their home country in Dubai. 

Meanwhile, the US is making deals with Australia and Britain to create landmark nuclear submarines that could help counter China&#39;s military development and assertive territorial claims across Asia. The Oscars have become processed, canned awards show thanks to ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once’ winning best picture and directing awards along with three of the four acting categories. 

In China, the new premier Li Qiang is trying to boost business confidence by appearing business-friendly, though he does have less power under the Chinese president Xi Jinping. Meanwhile an opioid settlement could potentially hurt patients&#39; access to a wide array of drugs for purpose such as ADHD, addiction, anxiety and pain relief.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
