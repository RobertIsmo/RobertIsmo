<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening all around the world right now. In Hollywood, they&#39;re trying to figure out how to make streaming work financially. At the same time, they’re struggling with what technology will mean for the future of the industry. Los Angeles is feeling the effects of strike action in Hollywood, as the entertainment industry is inextricably connected to the city. On a health-related note, medical device makers are profiting from artery-clearing procedures that often lead to amputations.

Moving close to home, there is some news related to New York and Long Island. For instance, there is an ongoing investigation into the Gilgo Beach killings. And New York has $1.1 billion allocated towards fighting floods, but researchers are concerned that it won&#39;t be enough.

Finally, there&#39;s good news out of Texas this summer - Barton Springs has become an oasis during this heat wave!</p>

<h3>Without Hollywood, What Happens to Los Angeles?</h3>

<p>With actors and screenwriters on strike, Hollywood is shut down for the foreseeable future.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
