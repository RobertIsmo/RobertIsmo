<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In tech, we&#39;ve got Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed FTX exchange, who has been found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. Meanwhile in politics, the House has approved $14.3 billion in aid for Israel, while in Ukraine and Gaza, US drones are flying to help with hostage recovery. Over in the Middle East, Gaza is facing horrific scenes after Israeli airstrikes. And closer to home, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have been testifying in their family business&#39; fraud trial. Plus, Trump has asked for federal appeals court to lift a gag order in an election case. Lastly, we&#39;ve got a super cool biennial art show taking place across Europe - all about war, democracy and solidarity!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
