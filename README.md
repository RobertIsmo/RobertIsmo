<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news in the world lately. First, there is now a pill for postpartum depression that can be taken for two weeks, so more women are able to get the treatment they need. Additionally, there was an indictment of Donald Trump during his election that caused some ramifications when it comes to the current funding fight and looming government shutdown. Moving on to Oklahoma, an Oklahoma man pleaded guilty to a threat against multiple Republicans. More international news has been coming out of Ukraine as they just hit a distant Russian ship with drones and more recently, NASA successfully communicated with Voyager 2 after sending an erroneous command to its antenna. Closer to home, mortgage rates have been increasing so people have been bragging about them, while also picking up on some personal finance advice due to being uncertain between renting or buying. Lastly, Mississippi just overturned their lifetime ban on voting for former felons so they can enjoy the democratic core of American citizenship again. Even though there has been a lot of positive news lately on the economy and other areas, President Biden hasn&#39;t gotten much credit for it yet.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
