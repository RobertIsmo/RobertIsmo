<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is facing an impending default that could cripple the economy, and President Biden is preparing to release another budget proposal. In Oklahoma, Rep. Josh Brecheen is advocating for deep spending cuts. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is refusing to make any commitments in the midst of economic uncertainty. As for immigration, the US government is considering bringing back detention of migrant families at the border. 

Elsewhere around the world, Russia&#39;s involvement in Ukraine has led to thousands of Russian deaths—none of which are being acknowledged by the Kremlin. Chinese industrial espionage has been revealed due to a daring ruse, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has blamed US-led &quot;encirclement and suppression&quot; for creating troubles.

In cities across America, parking lots are becoming scarce as local governments rethink their parking needs in order to better sustain the environment. Newly implemented safety regulations have placed rail heat sensors under scrutiny due to their possible role in a deadly Ohio train crash, as well as their poor federal regulation. To make matters worse, France is experiencing a nationwide strike over pension reform plans proposed by President Emmanuel Macron that would raise the legal age of retirement to 64. People are angry and confused with why their government would do this.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
