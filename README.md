<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of different things going on in the world right now. In the US, there is a scramble to stop Iran from providing drones to Russia as the war in Ukraine continues. There is also a lot of misinformation about Covid-19 going around, and Southwest Airlines has been under scrutiny for stranding passengers after canceling flights. On top of that, the West is dealing with a &#39;Atmospheric River&#39; that&#39;s bringing rain and snow, while a man was sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison for plotting to kidnap Michigan&#39;s governor. Meanwhile, Republicans are attacking the FBI as they investigate former President Donald Trump, and there is an intraparty fight between the right and farther right in the GOP while they figure out how to win back swing voters. In the business world, people are trying to turn offices into housing and Google employees are anxious about potential cost-cutting measures. Oakland&#39;s next mayor will be a Hmong American refugee, and Art Spiegelman, author of &quot;Maus,&quot; has had his book banned and discussed sanitization of history this past year. All in all, it&#39;s a lot to keep up with!</p>

<h3>Republicans Step Up Attacks on F.B.I. as It Investigates Trump</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
