<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, in the world there is some turmoil in Ukraine between Russia and Ukraine, with a group of mothers going to recover their children from Russian authorities. Meanwhile in America, former President Trump and his lawyers are trying to maintain his presence in the court of public opinion and there is an ongoing legal battle regarding the access to abortion pills as well as a heated political debate in Tennessee due to recent events. On a brighter note, Irish people are excited for President Biden&#39;s trip to Ireland, as he is said to be the most Irish president since John F. Kennedy. Many other aspects of life have been affected by the pandemic, including the UberEats and DoorDash delivery drivers who are making less money due to contactless delivery, as well as teachers in Los Angeles who must manage students&#39; grief due to Covid. Finally, there is a visit to Peeps factory for Easter and a quiz for readers of The New York Times about news this week.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
