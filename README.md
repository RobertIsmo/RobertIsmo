<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of economic, political, and social changes happening around the world. In the US, some people are worried about the lack of evidence for the US government’s insistence that Hamas was operating under Al-Shifa. Meanwhile, young people are facing economic despair and it could have implications for the 2024 US election. One family in Gaza had to fight to escape the war and a different congressman is pushing to expel Santos after a damning report. 

Across the world, Israeli and Palestinian activists have asked Americans to take their side in peace efforts. On top of that, China has been bulldozing old neighborhoods to revive their economy, along with having a subtle shift in the power balance with their leader Xi Jinping. There have also been attempts to fill up empty offices with housing in NYC’s financial district. In terms of sports, football has been facing safety concerns since researchers found that young players had CTE from head hits. And universities have been moving into empty buildings like John Hopkins University Bloomberg Center in order to become hubs for communities.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
