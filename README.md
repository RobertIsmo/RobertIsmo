<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot is happening in the world. In business, the screenwriters just reached a deal with studios to end their strike after 146 days, which could put talk shows back on the air. There&#39;s some tension between Hollywood actors and writers guilds right now, too. In other news, political prosecutions are moving forward for Donald Trump, so the authorities are worried about an increase in threats and anger from his supporters. In international news, Chinese ships are using machinery like water cannons and bullhorns to wall off the sea. They&#39;re creating a powerful coast guard that intimidates other nations in Asian waters. On the upside of things, Greece is having a great economic boom despite sharp memories of austerity measures. Finally, NASA&#39;s OSIRIS-REX spacecraft successfully returned home from its mission to the asteroid Bennu with a special gift in tow! </p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
