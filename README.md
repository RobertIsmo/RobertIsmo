<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of violence in the world right now. In the US, there is a police street crime unit called the Scorpions that has been intimidating and violent, leading to five of its officers being charged with murder during an arrest. At the same time, two emergency medical technicians were suspended after they failed to provide any care to Tyre Nichols for 19 minutes following his beat by police. In the sky, there is a weird phenomenon - a Chinese spy balloon that has disrupted international diplomacy. There have even been reports about rival foreign powers using advanced technology to surveil U.S military sites. On a lighter note, Mount Washington recently set a record for coldest wind chill ever recorded at minus 108 degrees! Democrats have also overhauled their primary calendar system, reshaping how the party picks its presidential nominees and highlighting more diverse states first. Putin has been making aggressive moves in Ukraine, pushing to take over a strategic town near a vital supply line and dispelling hopes for peace in the region. Finally, there are some cool things happening too - Lhakpa Sherpa climbed Everest ten times, an impressive feat for any human, let alone woman. And LeBron James continues to capture peoples’ attentions with his commitment to both his career and personal goals. Lastly, Pope Francis just visited Africa with the goal of ending displacement and breaking away from neutrality towards pain caused by acts of injustice and violence.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
