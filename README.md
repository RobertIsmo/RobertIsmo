<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of political tension both in the United States and around the world. In the US, there are a lot of divisive opinions about whether the coronavirus originated from a lab leak and what type of treatments should be used to fight it at Florida&#39;s public hospital. At the same time, China&#39;s president Xi is making a trip to Russia for what could be considered a peace mission. But on Africa’s continent, tensions seem to be rising between the US and Russia as each side takes increasingly aggressive action to assert its influence in the region. 

On top of that, there’s some disturbance in the banking world as American and global central banks are trying to stabilize markets in the middle of financial troubles at Silicon Valley Bank as well as UBS’s takeover of Credit Suisse. Meanwhile, in Phoenix, we&#39;re seeing an entire tent city set up as homelessness becomes an urgent problem. 

And lastly, Donald Trump is under investigation for various criminal offenses, including possible payoffs to women such as Stormy Daniels. There are many speculations about whether he is going to get indicted or not — but all I can tell you from my side is that he’s certainly getting a lot of pressure from his allies over this issue.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
