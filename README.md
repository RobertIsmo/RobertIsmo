<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is quite a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Republican leader McCarthy has to negotiate with his far-right factions to try and maintain control of their majority in the House. In business news, job growth in the hospitality, health care, and construction industries means that markets are now on the rise. A Buffalo Bills NFL player who suffered a cardiac arrest during a game was seen to be making positive progress this week and recordings were captured of the medical personnel responding to the emergency. In Idaho, a murder case exposed alarming details about four University of Idaho students who were killed two years ago. Scientists are beginning to explore the implications of creating conscious robots, while prosecutors connected with the Jan 6th riots continue to make arrests and gain convictions against those who stormed Capitol Hill. Ukraine is now receiving arms from countries previously thought ‘taboo’. Finally, debate continues in the US about how best to improve transportation infrastructure after it has become apparent that widening highways does not necessarily solve traffic problems. Over in sports news, there has been an increase in 50-point games as NBA teams become more &#39;loose&#39; and defensive play diminishes.</p>

<h3>As the N.B.A. Gets ‘Loose,’ 50-Point Games Are Surging</h3>

<p>Donovan Mitchell’s 71 points in a game this week was the top mark since 2006, but a rise in offense (and a lack of defense) has made high-scoring games a routine affair.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3WT5cXB"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
