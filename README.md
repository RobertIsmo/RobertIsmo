<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Philadelphia, Cherelle Parker just became the city&#39;s first female mayor after winning a tough election against a political veteran. A mother whose daughter was killed in a mass shooting sadly lost her race for mayor in Uvalde, Texas recently. Meanwhile, the US is telling Israel not to occupy Gaza indefinitely and Arab states are pushing for a ceasefire there. In Washington, Republicans are trying to come up with a budget before they face a government shutdown. The CDC just reported an alarming increase in infant syphilis cases and Barbra Streisand released her autobiography. At the Supreme Court, there&#39;s a legal battle over gun rights for domestic abusers and Biden&#39;s struggle to parallel Reagan&#39;s 1984 &#39;Morning in America&#39; campaign continues. Additionally, many people are reeling from the results of Ukraine&#39;s military ceremony that led to multiple deaths due to unsafe practices and a research paper about room-temperature superconductors was retracted last week. To top things off, Rebecca Yarros&#39; fantasy series &quot;Fourth Wing&quot; has become a huge bestseller with its thrilling plotlines involving dragons, magic and steamy sex.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
