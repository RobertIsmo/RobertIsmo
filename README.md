<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it seems like a lot of troubling news is coming out of the world. In the US, McCarthy has been pressured by the right to talk about impeaching Biden. Plus, former president Donald Trump may be facing a third indictment. At the same time, big consumer companies are raising prices in a way that is complicating the Federal Reserve&#39;s job. In markets across the world, people have been trading cautiously ahead of pivotal meetings like the Fed meeting. All of which affects things from mortgages to credit cards. 

In Europe, Vladimir Putin&#39;s relationship with Africa has been strained by collapsed grain deals and unclear fates for Wagner mercenaries. In Israel, the high court has agreed to review Netanyahu&#39;s judicial overhaul in September. Further issues are arising for Giuliani after he made false statements about Georgia election workers. Meanwhile, Melania Trump has mostly retreated from public life while her husband fights for his return to White House amidst his legal troubles. 

Going further abroad, life along the Korean DMZ still hasn&#39;t recovered seventy years after the war ended and heat waves with wildfire smoke have reached parts of northern US and Canada&#39;s outdoor summer season burned up with many fires raging while in Greece heavy wildfires have made animals even desert parts of this already heat stressed country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
