<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news recently related to the US and conflicts abroad. In the Middle East, there is a war going on between Gaza and Israel which has forced a 123-year-old Jewish nonprofit to take a neutral stance. The US is providing aid to Ukraine in the form of defense support, and American intelligence has reported that Russia has suffered heavy losses in their objective of eroding Western support for Ukraine. Closer to home, there was a ruling from the top court to allow Democrats to redraw the House map in New York. This follows with House Republicans becoming more accepting of an impeachment inquiry into President Biden after being encouraged by former President Donald Trump. In tech news, Google suffered an antitrust loss against Epic Games which could be indicative of its future legal battles. On another front, data about inflation has come in relatively steady ahead of a Fed meeting, helped along by gas prices decreasing rapidly - this in turn has led to increased optimism from consumers. Lastly, there was controversy at Harvard as billionaire investor Bill Ackman accused school President Claudine Gay of antisemitism, though she was later cleared of any &quot;research misconduct&quot; or plagiarism charges following an investigation. A Columbia University president also declined a congressional call to testify about her handling of antisemitism on campus, resulting in her losing her job as punishment.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
