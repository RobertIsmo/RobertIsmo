<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of major things happening in the world right now. In the US, we&#39;ve reached a year since Roe v. Wade was struck down, leading to drastic changes in the abortion landscape across the country. Polls have been showing that people&#39;s support for legal abortion is increasing, more evidence that this law has really mobilized people. The Supreme Court also revived Biden&#39;s immigration guidelines, which had been temporarily blocked by a Texas federal judge. There are also a lot of big cases currently being heard by the 6-to-3 conservative majority Supreme Court; lots of legal battles going on around guns and religion and climate change. 

In Ukraine, there&#39;s increased military activity as western-trained brigades have started to enter the fight. In addition, there&#39;s news out of China and Russia that a state-owned Chinese company sent large shipments of gunpowder to a Russian munitions factory last year. 

Internationally, there was an unsuccessful search for a missing American submersible in the Atlantic Ocean which ended when pieces were discovered on the ocean floor--five lives were lost in the incident. James Cameron made some comments about possible flaws in its design afterwards, and recent studies have backed some of his claims up. 

Finally, there&#39;s new developments in terms of racial reconciliation in the US. Charleston was recently opened up with a public museum honoring African American survival and resilience--it’s about more than just slavery. On another front, far-right groups are pushing through an alternate narrative around January 6th which is now at the heart of presidential politics.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
