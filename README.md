<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the United States, homeless camps in California are being cleared, but there&#39;s still a big problem with homelessness. There&#39;s also news on legal developments related to former President Donald Trump. His legal team has created a fund to cover the legal bills of his allies, and he just lost a defamation lawsuit against CNN. 

Around the world, there&#39;s news out of the Fertile Crescent about climate warnings and extreme temperatures. Russia is also dealing with drone attacks in Moscow, and Ukraine is having success with its counterattack against Russia. Meanwhile in Pakistan, a political rally was bombed and killed 43 people.

It&#39;s a time of big changes everywhere!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
