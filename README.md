<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world of business and economics, the Federal Reserve is set to make a policy decision on Wednesday following another bank collapse. Meanwhile, in the Eurozone, inflation has risen 7% prompting discussion about a possible rate increase. In the US, Treasury Secretary Yellen is warning that the country could be out of cash as soon as June 1. Hollywood writers have gone on strike, halting production of TV shows and movies, while Google is being called out for not adequately defunding climate change denial ads despite their promises to do so. On the international news front, Germany is quietly confronting Russian spies, while an expose has revealed a harsh sex trade built for American Soldiers in South Korea. Finally, hydropower is emerging as the future of electricity with pumped storage emerging more often than traditional dams.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
