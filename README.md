<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To bring you up to speed on what&#39;s happening in the world, there are a few major stories making headlines. In the US, an airman was indicted on charges of mishandling US government secrets. Separately, there&#39;s a big ongoing discussion around former president Trump&#39;s attachment to his &#39;beautiful mind&#39; boxes and a radical strategy he has promised to use against President Biden. Meanwhile, at home, the Supreme Court has recently upheld a Native American adoption law and justices have had some lurch-to-the-right decisions on abortion, guns, religion and climate change. 

Overseas, there are reports of Ukrainian troops still facing lethal threats in liberated villages despite Ukraine&#39;s efforts in counteroffensives. On climate change specifically, New Jersey is now requiring that it be taught at all grade levels in its schools with an emphasis on problem solving rather than doom and gloom. Lastly, among medical professionals here at home, there is a moral crisis arising from the corporatization of health care causing many doctors to feel estranged from their work.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
