<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers in the US that is leading to exhausted and demoralized workers — making them prone to dangerous mistakes on the job. Israelis are showing a lot of anger towards their prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for failing to prevent an attack by Hamas. In response, the Biden administration has proposed a rule cutting millions of tons of methane emissions. There&#39;s also a financial paradox blocking efforts to fight climate change -- it&#39;s much easier to find money for fossil fuel plants than for clean energy projects. To raise awareness about climate change, Pope Francis sent out a message through a Vatican envoy at the UN Climate Summit. Beyonce also just came out with a new movie&#x2F;concert film called &quot;Renaissance&quot;. It&#39;s become so popular that Houston fans flocked to watch it. Then, there was an unexpected tip about a suspected Indian murder-for-hire plot in the US that was foiled due to urgent action. Also, many families with aging loved ones are desperate to find affordable home care services, but there is a severe shortage and it can be tricky to find the right aide.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
