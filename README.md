<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the economy seems like it&#39;s in flux: unemployment is surprisingly low, inflation is falling but economists worry that a recession could be on the way. The banking sector is having some turbulence, but they still reported bumper profits in the quarter. It appears we´ll have to watch what happens there closely to see what it means for the overall economy. Meanwhile, stock pickers have had a hard time beating the market this year and last.

On top of that, there&#39;s plenty of other news happening around the world. A U.S airman revealed highly sensitive military documents during an online war game - and journalists are now on the hunt for them. In an unrelated story, there are people who refused to evacuate from the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown in 1986 and continued to live through its aftermath years later. To address climate change, electric solutions are becoming a more popular solution as we need to plug in millions of cars and homes.

Back here in the US, politics are a big topic. Black democratic activists have been expelled from Tennessee legislature for trying to channel civil rights leaders of past generations&#39; defiance tactics. And even though Texas has a long history of supporting public schools, Republican supporters are pushing for public vouchers so parents can use private school funds instead. Finally, the governor of Florida has been trying to navigate gun politics while at the same time addressing concerns from Trump supporters and Republicans repelled by him alike - which has become even more pressing as potential presidential candidates join in on the conversation ahead of 2024.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
