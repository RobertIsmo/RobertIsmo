<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a devastating earthquake in Turkey recently, which has left many people injured and homeless. In the US, prosecutors are seeking former President Donald Trump&#39;s lawyer&#39;s testimony, suggesting there is evidence of a crime. There have also been several shootings in the US, most recently at a Michigan State University campus. In terms of business, inflation is slowing compared to last year and Senator Dianne Feinstein has announced her retirement at the end of her term. On the international climate front, a new skyscraper has been built to be an environmental marvel but is rapidly becoming outdated. Finally, there have also been unexplained flying objects detected which may or may not be connected to China’s balloon surveillance program.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
