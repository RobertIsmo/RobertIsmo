<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a devastating train crash in India that killed more than 230 people and injured 900. It&#39;s been a country with long-standing issues of railway safety, so there&#39;s been an effort to improve things. Meanwhile, in the US, President Biden has praised the deal made to raise the debt ceiling to avoid economic calamity. Also in the US, former President Trump&#39;s legal team could not find the military document discussed in a recorded conversation. 

Outside of the US, NATO&#39;s newest member Finland hosted US Secretary of State Blinken who discussed Russia&#39;s &#39;failures&#39; and Ukraine is dealing with deaths due to a shelter closure as Russia evacuated border towns. Additionally, businesses are settling lawsuits concerning hazardous &quot;forever chemicals&quot; polluting public water sources, while Churchill Downs stopped racing until they investigate why 12 race horses died there recently. Finally, US defense secretary vowed to take continued military action near China and seek arms control talks for nuclear order established during the Cold War era.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
