<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In Ukraine, the president has criticized the United Nations Security Council for its inability to take action against Russia due to its veto power. In Azerbaijan, pro-Armenian leaders have given up control of the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh after Azerbaijan escalated the conflict. 
The US government has allowed nearly 500,000 Venezuelans living in the US to work legally, while also struggling to respond to a huge influx of Central American migrants along the Texas border. Senate confirmed General Charles Q. Brown Jr. as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff despite confrontation from Republican Senator Tommy Tubeville. Meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick B. Garland testified before Congress that prosecutors won&#39;t be intimidated by former President Trump&#39;s allies. The current climate debate was given an aggressive spin when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called out President Biden’s climate policy as “an agenda to control you” during a speech in Texas. On top of all this, two long-shot Republican hopefuls may not make it onto the next G.O.P. debate stage due to low poll numbers. 
In technology news, Google&#39;s voice assistant Bard has expanded its capabilities, but is still far from perfect. OpenAI has released a new version of its DALL-E image generator and incorporated it into their popular ChatGPT chatbot; both of which are available for testing purposes at the moment.</p>

<h3>Takeaways From Garland’s Testimony Before the House Judiciary Committee</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
