<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world recently! US politician Ron DeSantis is shaking up his campaign team, and the impeachment and censure of politicians has unfortunately become more normalized. Meanwhile, Chinese college graduates are under pressure to find jobs, while China&#39;s economic recovery is at risk from continued exports decline. In Taiwan, chefs are using unique ingredients to create a distinctive culinary culture apart from China. In New York, a game console giveaway raised tensions over police presence and control. The Black Sea became a rising global political hot spot, and cooking videos have taken over the internet. There&#39;s also an upcoming Ohio referendum that could affect abortion rights in the state. And finally, mourners gathered to pay their respects to iconic Irish singer Sinéad O’Connor in her last home town.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
