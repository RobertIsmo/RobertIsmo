<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of turmoil going on in the world at the moment. In Ukraine, the U.N.’s atomic agency is denouncing complacency over safety at the Zaporizhzhia plant after more Russian shelling forces the facility to move to its emergency power supply for the sixth time since it was invaded by Russia last year. In Russia, the Kremlin has been forcing cultural figures to conform to its militaristic worldview or risk being left behind. Meanwhile, in America, Senate minority leader Senator Mitch McConnell was recently hospitalized after a trip at a Washington hotel and Pennsylvania first-term Democrat Fetterman is being treated for severe clinical depression cloistered at Walter Reed while running his senate office from afar. Elsewhere, Australia is looking to buy new nuclear-powered submarines from the US and Britain in order to counter Chinese military buildup while Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News, has been getting scrutiny due to his influence on how news stories are relayed on television. Over in Israel, there have been mass protests in response to the right-wing government&#39;s proposed judicial changes that some have called unusually forceful and aggressive, which disrupted a visit by U.S. defense secretary and caused some Jewish American leaders to denounce the plan.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
