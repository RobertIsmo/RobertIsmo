<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world, tensions remain high between Israel and Palestine after one of the key peace negotiators was removed from their role. Meanwhile, in the tech world, a power struggle has erupted at OpenAI over the company leadership as tensions between investors and supporters of the former boss continue to grow. The healthcare industry is facing criticism for excessive fees that families must pay for assisted living services while many find them out of reach. In the US, a mother is searching for her son after he was fatally struck by an SUV driven by an off-duty police officer on the day she last saw him. Additionally, Ukraine and Russia are engaged in a conflict being fought over radio frequencies, while McDonald&#39;s is getting into fashion, and NYT readers can take a quiz to show how well they follow current events.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
