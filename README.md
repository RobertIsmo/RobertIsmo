<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, climate change is becoming an increasingly pressing issue. Trump’s time in office led to an exodus of environmental policy experts, leaving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) “traumatized” and struggling to fulfill its mission. Meanwhile, police officers in Torrance, California recently encountered a fugitive who pulled off the road and took his own life. Closer to home, a trial involving members of a far-right militia ended with four of them convicted of sedition. Down in Georgia, the House Jan 6 committee reported that former President Donald J Trump was at the center of efforts to overturn results of the election there. Elsewhere, a jury convicted a man who posed with his boot on Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk during the Jan 6 Capitol riots. To help prevent future widespread infections from happening again, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed offering new shots of Covid-19 vaccines each fall. In Moscow, some people risked criminal charges to protest Russia&#39;s bombing campaigns in Ukraine by leaving flower bouquets and plush toys at a statue commemorating a Ukrainian poet. Meanwhile, Elin Hilderbrand fans were able to meet up for fun activities like dancing and drinking espresso martinis on Nantucket Island. Moving onto tech companies- years of easy money pumped billions into start-ups and experimenting with physical realities have come to an end this year when reality hit hard in 2023. Closer to home, regulators concluded that an anesthesiologist made several potentially life-threatening mistakes when administering epidurals that resulted in one deadly incident. And lastly, as workspaces slowly open up again after such a long lockdown period, many employers are trying to figure out ways they can provide meals for their employees without having to open large corporate cafeterias.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
