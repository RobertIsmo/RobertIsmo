<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been happening on the national and global scale - especially in the US! In Texas, a judge approved a woman&#39;s request for an abortion despite state bans, signaling an important milestone for those in similar post-Roe cases. Overseas, Hanukkah has taken on a new meaning as Israelis mark the holiday in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. Holiday symbols also have people concerned about safety here at home. A hospital is earning money from performing weight loss surgeries on poor patients and Rikers Island prisoners, which brings up ethical issues. There&#39;s also been strong words exchanged between Congresswoman Stefanik and Harvard faculty over campus antsemitism. Germany is seeing a clamp down on criticism of Israel, while some art events are being canceled to due to it.

As for former President Trump, he&#39;s now facing imminent legal and political trials while also appealing immunity rulings. He&#39;s making headlines again as he seeks another term - but it has led Democrats into questioning what is best for the party. In South Carolina, Nikki Haley is preparing for another run in 2024, although her state and party have changed since her last election. Meanwhile Chris Christie, after his feisty debate performance drawing attention to Donald Trump, has been visiting New Hampshire for votes - so it will be interesting to see how things develop when the next election rolls around!</p>
