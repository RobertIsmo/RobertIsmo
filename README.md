<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world has been busy lately. In the business world, the Federal Reserve released hundreds of pages documenting how they failed to prevent the collapse of a Silicon Valley Bank. Paychecks rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier, which is great news for workers but could complicate the Fed&#39;s efforts to control inflation. Meanwhile, in science news, the US is wiring Ukraine with radiation sensors to detect any nuclear blasts. In US news, former Vice President Pence appeared before a grand jury regarding Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to keep power and there was also some controversy over a transgender lawmaker in Montana being barred from participating in the legislative session. Looking beyond our borders, China&#39;s popular live shopping craze has been seeing some changes due to increased competition and government surveillance. And finally, in sports news, the Carolina Panthers surprised no one by selecting Bryce Young of Alabama as part of round 1 for this year&#39;s NFL draft.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
