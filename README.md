<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, Republicans in Congress blocked aid to Ukraine, putting the country&#39;s fight against Russia in jeopardy. Meanwhile, some Senate Republicans have shown waning support for the effort, contradicting Mitch McConnell&#39;s push to continue providing financial aid. Chris Christie and Vivek Ramaswamy also had a heated argument on the debate stage and Kevin McCarthy said he would be leaving Congress at the end of the year. In addition, House Republicans threatened Hunter Biden with contempt charges when he resisted testifying in private and it appears college presidents are avoiding questions about antisemitism. Looking at overseas news, Israel and Hamas are having a battle for a city in Gaza that has caused an exodus of thousands of people. And finally, a shooter opened fire at University of Nevada, Las Vegas and killed three people. Rest in peace Norman Lear, a producer of iconic sitcoms such as All in the Family who passed away recently; Rob Reiner remembered him as a “real champion of America”. Lastly, the White House has delayed their decision on whether or not to ban menthol cigarettes because they are facing mounting opposition from activists, small businesses, and tobacco companies.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
