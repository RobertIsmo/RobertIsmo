<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now, and it&#39;s making headlines. At Harvard University in the US, the future of the President, Claudine Gay, is uncertain as the Board convenes to assess her role. In Congress and universities across America, a debate has emerged over whether or not anti-Zionism is considered antisemitism. Meanwhile, there is also a debate about who should lead universities in the wake of the controversy at Harvard and UPenn over antisemitism. On the followinng note, special counsel has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump is immune from prosecution. 

Over in Israel, a border community called Kfar Aza has been ravaged by Hamas-led assault and its residents killed and kidnapped. The thing that makes this so poignant is that some people see its rehabilitation as an indicator of Israel&#39;s future. In Maine in the US, Army Blast exposure may have played a role in a gunman&#39;s rampage recently, prompting medical scientists and military investigators to look into whether there was a link between his psychological collapse and brain damage from being an instructor in grenade training. 

Renters are being hit very hard here in America too with record rent burdens battering low-income life. More tenants than ever spend half or more of their income for some kind of shelter, leaving less for other things and often having nowhere to call home. And then there’s a family in upstate New York setting the world record for having the most lights on their residential property - raising questions among neighbors about what it means to celebrate Santa&#39;s arrival! 

The climate crisis is something else entirely - and countries most at risk are calling the proposed climate agreement a ‘death warrant’ with no commitment to phasing out fossil fuels that cause global heating. To add to all this, researchers have found that a quarter of freshwater fish species are at risk of extinction due to climate change compounding other threats to plants and animals.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
