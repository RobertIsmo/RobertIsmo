<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of different things happening in the world right now. In the US, a Fifth Court of Appeals just published an order in an abortion pill case and two Tennessee lawmakers were expelled from the House and then reinstated. An investigation into former President Trump’s handling of classified information is also underway and he just sued his former lawyer Michael Cohen for revealing his confidences. Meanwhile, leaked documents have revealed broad infighting among Russian officials and in Ukraine there has been a bloody stand for Bakhmut. Finally, Fox News was sanctioned by a judge for withholding evidence in a defamation case.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
