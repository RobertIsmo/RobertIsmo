<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is quite a lot going on in the world right now. Businesswise, the Federal Aviation Administration has issued a groundstop due to a Notice to Air Mission (NOTAM). At the same time, California is being hit by heavy storms and homeless people are having difficulty surviving. On top of that, the United States House of Representatives has approved an inquiry into what they believe is the U.S. government&#39;s attempt to target conservative voices. Meanwhile, the IRS backlog issue continues as Republicans apply more pressure and it&#39;s causing major problems for taxpayers. 

In New York City, nurses have been on strike at two hospitals and there has been reported chaos during this time. The Supreme Court has decided to leave a new gun law in place related to carrying firearms in public which was enacted in response to a June ruling that impacted gun control. 

The Golden Globes returned on TV with some awkward moments but relative success; several winners took home film and TV trophies to hopefully get a business and award season boost. However, it remains to be seen whether its legitimacy as an awards show will recover or not.

Finally, President Joe Biden was apparently unaware that classified documents were found in his private office, containing briefing materials from his time as vice president. The U.S. Justice Department is currently looking into how both President Biden and former President Trump came to possess such documents after leaving office, with some key differences between the two cases.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
