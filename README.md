<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of political tensions lately in the US. Former President Trump is facing an inquiry into allegations of sexual misconduct and misuse of funds, plus he has been ordered not to comment on a judge&#39;s staff in a fraud case. In addition, he&#39;s been making violent remarks lately, and even wanted to fire missiles at Mexico. On the other hand, Republicans are now planning to send troops to Mexico against drug cartels, and they are detaining undocumented immigrants as witnesses in smuggling cases. There is also a brain drain happening in China as its brightest minds look elsewhere for opportunity. As for international relations, the Senate is sending a delegation to China during its recess despite tensions between the two countries. As for Russia, there is a tactic called &#39;elastic defense&#39; that is helping it out right now. On the health&#x2F;wellness front, many people are not aware of insulin resistance or what early signs they should look for so they can take it seriously. Fortunately, there are ways to get insulin resistance in check if you act soon enough.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
