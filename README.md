<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension between the US and China as Biden and Xi had a meeting and the progress made was not what both countries were hoping for. In the US on a more local level, the Senate had just passed a bill that prevents a government shutdown but resulted in some hard-liners rebelling in the House. There have been numerous protests here too, such as at Columbia University after two pro-Palestinian groups were suspended until the end of the semester. 

Globally, more news includes a raid on a Gaza hospital by Israel which many consider to be a watershed moment in an increasingly intensified conflict, and the United Nations Security Council imploring for the implementation of humanitarian pauses. 

Finally, there are some slightly less daunting stories such as one about catalytic converters being stolen and sold to third parties and another about someone who thought they had a painting worth 10 million dollars but it ended up selling for far less than anticipated.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
