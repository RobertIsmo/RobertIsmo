<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, many people have been affected by the devastating wildfires in Hawaii and are wondering if they have a place in the recovery process. FEMA estimates rebuilding the damaged areas will take 5.5 billion dollars. In Georgia, there is a grand jury investigation into Trump&#39;s election interference. 
In regards to the Hunter Biden saga, Republicans initially looked to open a special counsel investigation but now oppose it while Democrats seem to be averting their eyes and downplaying any worries. 
In Ukraine, President Zelensky was once seen as a criminal, but now he is calling for guns and ammo. Ukraine is making progress in its military counteroffensive, with its troops advancing 10-12 miles along two main lines of attack. 
At the Iowa State Fair recently, Donald Trump was the only one of the Republican candidates that attended. Despite polling in the mid-single digits, Vivek Ramaswamy has projected outsize confidence that he has a 50% chance of winning the presidency. Finally, inexpensive add-on devices known as “switches” are turning ordinary pistols into fully automatic machine guns, leading to an increased threat to bystanders.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
