<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. On the global stage, China and Russia are drawing closer as alarm grows about Western countries getting involved in Asia. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut is being defended in a battle which has been documented by Times photographers since May 2022. 

In the U.S., President Biden and Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy had a &#39;productive&#39; meeting to try to prevent the nation from defaulting on their debt for the first time ever. A new report underscores this increasing likelihood after Memorial Day passes. And in New York, lottery preferences for affordable housing are facing a court battle over whether they violate antidiscrimination laws.

On a lighter note, at Atlantic College - located in a 12th-century Welsh castle - teenage royals are taking classes on world peace, and Vienna is being praised for its approach to affordable housing.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
