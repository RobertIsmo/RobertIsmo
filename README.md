<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there is an ongoing fight that is making talks of negotiations more tense than ever. Meanwhile, Russia is implementing new high school textbooks that are designed to justify the war in Ukraine.  In the US, Mitch McConnell released a letter claiming to be medically clear to work after his health episode. In business, companies have been hit hard with empty office space due to the pandemic. Pope Francis visited a small flock in Mongolia to encourage faith but it could also suggest closer diplomatic ties with China and Russia. Additionally, South Africa recently experienced an intense fire which killed 74 people and Johannesburg residents are still trying to identify victims. On top of that, Silicon Valley billionaires have been investing in rural land in California in order to create a metropolitan city from scratch, while a teenage trailblazer of women’s tennis was once denied the ability to play on boys&#39; teams. And finally, the one-handed backhand technique has become nearly obsolete in tennis despite it being such an iconic stroke in sports history.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
