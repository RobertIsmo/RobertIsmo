<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, markets are still betting on a U.S. Congress and White House deal but the uncertainty is taking a toll on the economy. Ukraine&#39;s President asked for more aid from G7 countries like India and Brazil, while Russia has imposed sanctions on various U.S. people, most of whom were former President Donald J. Trump&#39;s enemies. A new term is making rounds in finance called &#39;de-risking&#39; which reflects how countries are dealing with a rising China. Meanwhile, Russian paramilitary forces say they have taken a city in Ukraine but Ukrainian officials deny the claim even though they describe the situation as “critical”. In Florida, governor DeSantis is struggling to win support across the Republican Party by avoiding talk of an abortion ban that he signed into law. A Michigan non-profit is paying for DeSantis&#39;s private jets as he travels around the country preparing to run for president, though they won&#39;t say where the money is coming from. Notable British author Martin Amis passed away at 73 and his books are famous for their semi-autobiographical bleak comedies. The auto industry isn&#39;t seeing relief as much as everyone had hoped because inflation is slow to decrease and now e-sports teams are selling off further demonstrating an uncertain future in that field. Lastly, not many people can fathom why Hawaiians are increasingly moving to Las Vegas when there&#39;s no ocean in sight!</p>

<h3>Martin Amis, Acclaimed Author of Bleakly Comic Novels, Dies at 73</h3>

<p>In books like “Money” and “The Information,” he created “a high style to describe low things,” as he put it.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
