<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Food prices are rising, putting strain on seniors and their savings. Meanwhile, President Biden has picked Fed official Lael Brainard to be his top economic advisor, and Jared Bernstein will be in charge of the Council of Economic Advisers. There&#39;s also been some recent tragedy, like the killing of an American aid worker in Ukraine by a guided missile. In Russia, there&#39;s a secretive network of activists smuggling dissidents out of the country who are facing long prison sentences. 

On the political front, former US ambassador Nikki Haley is running for president, while Democrats are meddling again in a Republican primary race in Wisconsin. In other news overseas, Chinese officials are portraying objections over a U.S.-launched spy balloon as a sign of America&#39;s decline. Online language around expressions of love is rapidly changing too, as well as people&#39;s awareness that balloons aren&#39;t just toys anymore--they can also contain spying devices. Valentine&#39;s Day is coming up so New Yorkers are asking if they&#39;re feeling the love. Social media sites have been taking it on the chin with layoffs and glitches adversely affecting Chinese activists who have recently been using Twitter to express their grievances.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
