<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Israel, a massacre of its young people recently occurred amid tension between Palestinians and those seeking the state&#39;s right to exist. To help deter hostile actions, the US is expanding its military presence in the region. In Africa and parts of Asia, a shortage of fertilizer is affecting food prices and leading to malnutrition. In the US, Biden&#39;s presidential campaign has raised more money than Trump&#39;s in the same quarter of his 2020 re-election campaign. Meanwhile, a 15-year-old was ejected from a GOP event only to later be allowed back in. And at the American Museum of Natural History, scrutiny of its practices involving human remains has sparked change.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
