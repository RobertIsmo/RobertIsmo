<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! The Chinese government is attempting to become more business friendly and make changes to help the economy, while investors are cautious about corporate financial results because of the pandemic. Here in the US, President Biden is facing questions about his handling of classified documents, and Governor Youngkin of Virginia may be running for president. Meanwhile, travel has been slowly rebounding as people look for new places to explore, even as the US is trying to fight back against Chinese outposts that collect intelligence outside their jurisdiction. Closer to home, nurses in NYC recently went on strike but have since reached a deal. On a more personal level, AI has been providing us with more attention than ever with its face filters and selfie apps. Lastly, there is data showing that Black real estate agents and brokers are not compensated as much as their white peers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
