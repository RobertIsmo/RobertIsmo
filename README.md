<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on around the world. In Ukraine, President Biden took a long train ride to show support for the country, which has been invaded by Russia for a year now. Sadly, two people who got married in Ukraine and then served in the war effort died together in a trench. 

In finance, a hedge fund billionaire secured a big exit package when he retired last year. Meanwhile, the U.S. is trying to study unexplained flying objects, while also looking into whether they can legally regulate what people post online. Additionally, there is concern over people using a psychedelic-like drug at home to treat mental health conditions without enough evidence of its safety. 

Locally, people in East Palestine are skeptical of official tests regarding toxic chemicals since a train derailment. There have also been reports of public funds being used to support private schools in a Hasidic village in NY. And the pandemic has caused increased burnout among healthcare workers leading them to rethink the job incentives for nurses.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
