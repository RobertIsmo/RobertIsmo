<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now! In the US, President Biden is getting ready to release a budget that is likely to be rejected by Republicans. Meanwhile, Georgia has plans to withdraw a bill that was similar to legislation in Russia aimed at clamping down on dissent. In the entertainment industry, Topol, whose most famous role was as Tevye in &#39;Fiddler on the Roof&#39;, passed away at 87 years old. 
In political news, newly empowered Democrats in Michigan voted to repeal a right-to-work law and expand gun background checks, while Fox News has been dealing with conflicts between their hosts and executives over Trump&#39;s election fraud claims. On an international scale, there are worries of life expectancy decreases in African countries due to diseases like diabetes and hypertension that often go undiagnosed and untreated. Plus, Russian cultural figures are making their choice to either comply with the government&#39;s militaristic worldview or speak out against it. Lastly, there&#39;s a great article about understanding why poverty persists in American society written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning sociologist!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
