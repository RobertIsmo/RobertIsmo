<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening around the world right now. In Ukraine, the U.S. is sending volunteers to the battlefield with access to American weapons, despite some of them having no military experience. In Syria, there has been an attack that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded others, which has escalated tensions. Meanwhile in Italy, population aging is creating concerns about how elderly people will be cared for and robots may play a role in addressing this need. 

Here in the U.S., there is news of stolen guns from parked cars becoming a point of contention in gun regulation debates, as well as former Trump officials facing scrutiny for trial testimonies. Trump himself is giving a rally at Waco over the weekend - Waco being a small town of significance due to its connection to a right-wing cause and government overreach 30 years ago. Lastly, a tech legend and Intel co-founder Gordon E. Moore passed away at 94 and is known for predicting expansions of computer chip technology which helped guide us into the age of high tech we find ourselves in today.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
