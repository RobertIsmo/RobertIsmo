<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Donald Trump has been charged with interfering with an election in Georgia and his lawyers are trying to get his trial moved back to 2026. Meanwhile, in California, they avoided catastrophe from a rare tropical storm, but the Pacific Northwest is dealing with smoke-filled skies due to raging wildfires. British Columbia has recorded at least 50 buildings burned. On the political side of things, Democrats are rooting for a rowdy Republican debate where abortion bans will be discussed and Vivek Ramaswamy&#39;s foreign policy approach is being scrutinized by his fellow GOP candidates. Music-wise, an unknown artist named Oliver Anthony Music is topping the charts. There&#39;s also a legal battle against race-based admissions standards at Thomas Jefferson High School in Virginia and Sha&#39;Carri Richardson became the fastest woman in the world at a track event. The tech world welcomed Waymo&#39;s robot taxis that are now available for riders in San Francisco, and scientists are questioning whether nuclear war could be stopped if it was all happening in our heads.</p>

<h3>Democrats, Popcorn in Hand, Root for a Rowdy G.O.P. Debate</h3>

<p>Top Democrats, suddenly feeling a bit better about 2024, would love to see Republicans talk about a national abortion ban.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
