<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got some news about the world - it sounds like things are getting more and more complicated. Recently, there&#39;s been a deadly missile strike in South America that wounded three Colombians who were trying to rally people around Ukraine, and Europe is struggling with how to make Russia pay for the war. Closer to home, Donald Trump is facing major charges in a documents case, and the US military justice code is going through its largest overhaul since 1950. 

The economy is also making people worried. Wage growth slowed in the second quarter and the Fed&#39;s preferred inflation measure cooled in June, but Wall Street pessimists have been proven wrong so far by the S&amp;P 500, which is up 20 percent this year. 

It&#39;s gotten too hot to handle too - temperatures around New York City reached dangerously high levels for two straight days recently, while Europe has resorted to age-old ways to stay cool during summer heat waves. 

Finally, there have been exciting advances in artificial intelligence and quantum tech that will transform national security across the globe, testing US alliances in the process.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
