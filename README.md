<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening around the world right now. In the US, there is a long-running heatwave that has been intensifying in the Southwest. There is also a court battle over documents related to former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, over in Europe, there is tension as protesters have gathered at an Israeli airport in objection to a government plan to limit judicial oversight. Additionally, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears to be refocusing his attention from Russia to the West, raising speculation about the future of diplomatic ties. Finally, there is business news as well; Microsoft is set to finalize a $70 billion deal with Activision and presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy has developed an innovative fundraising strategy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
