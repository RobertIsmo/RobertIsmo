<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are a bit chaotic in the world right now. In Russia, they are cracking down on Western media, arresting an American reporter and making it harder for the West and Russia to interact. Meanwhile in Ukraine, there is a standoff between Russian and Ukrainian forces that has been costly for both sides but seems to be working in the Ukrainians favor. 

In the US, Republican lawmakers are pushing for expanded access to firearms despite numerous mass shootings that have taken place recently. On the immigration front, some popular US counties are seeing an influx of people even as most other places see population decline. The exception to this pattern is New York City&#39;s Manhattan borough.

It&#39;s also busy in the sports world with baseball season officially starting today. MLB teams are playing their first games and Aaron Judge already hit a home run in the Yankees&#39; win. There is also a pitch clock now, with Marcus Stroman of the Cubs getting the first pitch clock violation!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
