<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of tensions and conflicts in the world between countries, but some recent news focuses on the increased violence between Israel and Palestine. The US is pressing Israel to take measures to reduce civilian death tolls and to restore services. Meanwhile, negotiations are underway for a possible hostage deal between Hamas and Israel, with each side making difficult choices and struggling to trust one another. In other news, newly elected US House Speaker Johnson has been met with criticism from members of his own party due to his leadership style. Additionally, there are financial discussions about long-term care insurance falling short for many elderly Americans, and the US is taking action against crypto exchanges that have knowledge about criminal activity. Lastly, some opinion pieces offering insight into the situation have been written as well.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
