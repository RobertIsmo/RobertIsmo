<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In the US, Ohio voters just rejected a constitutional change intended to restrict access to abortions, and President Trump has been in the news as mulling over legal strategies to overturn Biden&#39;s election win. Meanwhile, in Georgia, the District Attorney is about to present evidence from an election interference investigation to a grand jury. In terms of President Biden’s initiatives, he has announced plans to restrict certain investments in China that are seen as national security threats. Finally, overseas in Ukraine there have been two separate missile strikes on a city that have killed nine people and injured eighty-two others.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
