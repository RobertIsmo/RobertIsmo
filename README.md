<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world lately. In the business world, wages and prices could be showing signs of cooling down ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting, while higher food prices have been bringing in bigger profits for large packaged food companies. The Eurozone economy also recently showed signs of modest growth. 

In U.S. news, former Vice President Mike Pence appeared before a grand jury to give his testimony on Donald Trump&#39;s attempts to retain power in the 2020 election. Meanwhile, a transgender lawmaker has been exiled from Montana as the G.O.P. flexes its new power, and the governor&#39;s nonbinary son is asking him to reject upcoming bills pertaining to the LGBTQ+ community. 

On a lighter note, China&#39;s live shopping craze is shining a light on the dashed dreams and bright promises of stardom while Randi Weingarten is proving her worth at the center of America&#39;s political fights. Lastly, there’s also been some big developments in sports- NFL Draft picks for 2023 came out recently and Round One of this year&#39;s draft just wrapped up with some surprises along the way!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
