<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been a bit turbulent in the world lately! US markets have been in turmoil and the US banking system is still sound, according to Treasury Secretary Yellen. The European Central Bank is making key decisions that could shape how far the financial worries ripple out throughout the global economy. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs&#39; dealings with Silicon Valley Bank have been called into question. In Ukraine, the military is using an alarming amount of weapons as it tries to hold back a city in eastern Ukraine. 

The US government is taking steps to ban TikTok and other countries are following suit due to its ties with Chinese internet company ByteDance and concerns about user data safety. There&#39;s also worrying news about pregnant women during the pandemic–deaths have spiked 40% in the US this year. Here in the states, Florida is censoring math textbooks and attempted to remove mentions of racial injustice while a massive snowstorm in California prevented one man from seeing his dying wife. There are even issues faced by Fulbright-Hays applicants who grew up speaking the language of their proposed country for research but are penalized by an Education Department regulation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
