<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of destruction going on in other parts of the world lately. In Libya, a dam collapse has caused deadly flooding and more than 5,000 people have died. In Morocco, an earthquake has just happened, which is being referred to as the “blind earthquake” because there were few indications that it was coming. Meanwhile, in the US, President Biden is facing an impeachment inquiry by Congress after some far-right Republicans argued over government spending. In addition, Apple is launching its new iPhone 15 with a USB-C charger and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled that a popular decongestant found in cold medicines isn’t effective at all. Lastly, New York City sports fans have been dealing with disappointment after Aaron Rodgers, the Jets player quarterback, suffered a season-ending injury during the opening minutes of their first regular season game.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
