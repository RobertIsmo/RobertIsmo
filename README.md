<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of tension in the world lately. Allies are at odds over how to address the situation in Ukraine, and the NATO alliance is having to manage fractures on strategy. On a more personal level, people have been shocked by recent tech layoffs and their lack of preparation for this kind of event. In the US, there was a Republican-backed candidate charged with shootings even after red flags had been raised, reigniting debates over gun safety. On the other hand, there has been a march for life in Washington to rally against Roe v. Wade overturning right to abortion. Also, the Supreme Court recently investigated a leak concerning their employees. 

Another topic in the news is Lawrence Ray, the ringleader of a sex cult at Sarah Lawrence College who was just sentenced to sixty years in jail. To honor David Crosby who passed away this week, many outlets put together lists of his fifteen essential songs and highlighted his Twitter presence. Meanwhile, technology is leaping forward with bots pushing past Turing test as artificial intelligence becomes smarter and more advanced.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
