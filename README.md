<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some interesting changes in the world recently – Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin are planning to meet in Russia to discuss weapons, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had a friendly meeting with Putin, a top Russian general was briefly detained after a mutiny, China&#39;s biggest homebuilder is reeling from the slowing economy, there&#39;s controversy over a Detroit tiny home program meant for low-income residents, and Elaine LaLanne (the first lady of fitness) is 97 and still shaping the industry. Unfortunately, there&#39;s also been Steve Harwell (of Smash Mouth fame) passing away at 56. Beyond this, Nikki Haley is gaining attention as she has a playbook for winning tough races leading up to 2024 and Burning Man attendees have been stranded due to torrential rain. However, it isn&#39;t all bad news – Coco Gauff has taken this year&#39;s US Open by storm!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
