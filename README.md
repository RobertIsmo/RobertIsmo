<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of political upheaval going on in the US right now. Trump supporters have been using alarming rhetoric to defend him after his indictment, and his personal aide has been charged alongside him. Trump is casting his campaign as an existential fight against his critics, and there is escalating tension between Ukraine and Russia. In India, there was recently a tragic train disaster with 288 people dead in overcrowded cars, and Silicon Valley is grappling with implications of artificial intelligence. The Supreme Court is ruling on race-conscious college admissions after Democrats failed to pass an affirmative action campaign in California. And, unfortunately, Ted Kaczynski - the infamous Unabomber - died by suicide while serving time in prison for killing three people. On the flip side, sex therapist Emily Morse is advocating for more open relationships and talking about exploring your own sexual desires.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
