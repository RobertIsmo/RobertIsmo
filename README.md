<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now! In New York, a suspect has been arrested in the serial killings of women near Gilgo Beach. In Iowa, former Vice President Pence was put on the spot over the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. He also recently raised just $1.2 million for his 2024 bid, which some are seeing as a worrying sign about his political future. Meanwhile, in Wimbledon, Dead &amp; Company are closing out their &#39;Final Tour&#39; and Novak Djokovic is playing in the tournament finals. In Texas during this punishing summer heat wave, people are seeking refuge in Barton Springs. Additionally, the Education Department is cancelling $39 billion in student debt for 800,000 borrowers, and offering one-time credits to fix mistakes made by loan servicers when collecting payments under income-driven repayment programs. All this and more make it an incredibly interesting - and busy - time!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
