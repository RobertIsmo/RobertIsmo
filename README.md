<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, in the US, former President Trump&#39;s trial is raising questions about public trust in the justice system. There are also still unanswered questions surrounding why he was hoarding sensitive government documents. In Ukraine, there have been large-scale military operations in Europe since World War II, and Saudi Arabia has been leveraging its wealth and influence despite condemnation of its human rights violations. In Spain, former intelligence agent José Manuel Villarejo Pérez is facing prison time for releasing secret recordings.Amid all this, Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) continues to revolutionize work like never before but opinions on how it&#39;ll actually affect employment remain split. There are also shades of nuclear weapons debates when experts warned of A.I.&#39;s potential dangers and called for regulation. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson&#39;s attempts to make a comeback as British Prime Minister may be futile and four missing children have recently been found alive in a Colombian Jungle after 40 days of searching following a plane crash which killed three adults on board.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
