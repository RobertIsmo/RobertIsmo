<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, some important news stories are happening in the US and NYC area. In the US, the House of Representatives recently passed a defense bill that had controversial social policy provisions attached, setting up a potential showdown with the Senate. In NYC, there were some major developments in two cases. There was an arrest made in a series of serial killings near Gilgo Beach on Long Island, and police are reporting new progress due to their new chief. There is also a actors&#39; strike happening in Hollywood, with Fran Drescher - who became famous as &#39;The Nanny&#39; - now taking the lead as president of the union leading the strike. This could have affect on movie theaters and festivals. Meanwhile in Iowa, there was an exchange between VP Pence and an Iowa voter, which could be indicative of Pence&#39;s 2024 campaign ambitions. On Long Island again, there&#39;s some interesting news about freshman Republican George Santos who has been using most of his fundraising money to pay himself back, while his colleague Mike Lawler revealed he raised $900K in the same period. Finally, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio is unexpectedly winning praise from New Yorkers for his handling of his split from his wife Chirlane McCray. And at Wimbledon, a team of workers is picking and packing two million strawberries that will be served over the course of the tournament.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
