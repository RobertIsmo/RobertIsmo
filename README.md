<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In honor of Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s birthday, President Biden gave a speech at Ebenezer Baptist Church and reassured the audience that good will overcome evil. There&#39;s also a new bronze sculpture in Boston commemorating the hug that Dr. King and Coretta Scott King shared after he won the Nobel Peace Prize. The U.S Supreme Court recently heard cases regarding affirmative action in college admissions, which could have lasting implications for students in the future if upheld. 

Internationally, thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have fled to Bali to escape escalating war tensions between their countries. Furthermore, in Ukraine a Russian missile attack left many dead and rescue workers had to work to clear the debris of a residential building. In Switzerland, snow levels are rapidly decreasing due to an unusually warm winter, fundamentally changing how ski resorts and sporting events operate.

An influx of migrants in New York could cost up to $2 billion dollars, prompting New York City Mayor Eric Adams press the federal government for financial assistance. California has been experiencing endless storms recently, leaving 19 dead so far. There was also a deadly plane crash in Nepal leaving 68 dead and only four survivors out of the 72 passengers on board. Lastly, college students are talking about Auburn University banning TikTok, which brings a geopolitical fight to the forefront for its biggest fans--young Americans.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
