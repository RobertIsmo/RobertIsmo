<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It has been a busy few months around the world - in October, there were Hamas attacks on Israeli towns including Be&#39;eri. In Yemen, Houthi militia have been launching attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Russia is signaling that they would be open to a cease-fire in Ukraine, but Ukraine was just accused of embezzling $40 million for military shells. President Trump is in some legal trouble and some Democrats are worried he might be a drag on their races. The Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of Trump&#39;s delay strategy. Hallmark and Lifetime have been churning out a steady stream of holiday movies and researchers took it upon themselves to analyze them all. Archaeologists are looking for centuries-old catacombs beneath Mexican ruins. NFL playoffs are looming and with week 16, the picture starts to show itself. And notable people such as Sandra Day O&#39;Connor, Henry Kissinger, Rosalynn Carter, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, Jim Brown, Tina Turner, Dianne Feinstein, Pat Robertson, Jimmy Buffett, Silvio Berlusconi, Norman Lear, Cormac McCarthy, David Crosby and Matthew Perry all passed away this year.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
