<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of goings-on in the world right now. In the US, an FBI inquiry is underway to hold Syrian officials&#39;s accountable for war crimes like torture and detention. An 84 year old man has been charged with shooting a Black teenager who went to the wrong house and a man in upstate New York is charged with murder after shooting a woman who went up the wrong driveway. 

In international news, there has been talk over different strategies regarding Russia’s war on Ukraine and China’s assertiveness among Group of 7 nations. There have been complications for regular people due to European Union blacklists of people linked to the war. Also, Mexico has become the biggest user of a controversial spy tool called Pegasus.

In science news, there&#39;s a new telescope being built in Chile and satellites could help research into space weather and other subjects.  Additionally, House Judiciary Committee just held a hearing recently on victims of violent crime in Manhattan. 

And while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis tried to get rid of one of his helpers, Donald Trump was very happy to bring her in from exile.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
