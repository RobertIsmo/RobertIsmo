<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of developments happening in the world right now. Putin has signaled an end to formal arms control with the US, and Russian shelling has killed at least six people in Kherson. Meanwhile, China is trying to mend relations with Europe but is being blocked by Russia. 

In the US, a school and artist are fighting over murals of slavery in Vermont, as well as a coast-to-coast winter storm that&#39;s causing travel delays and power outages. In New York, this winter has been abnormally warm, so bad for ski slopes but good for sunbathers. Also in the US, there&#39;s been a surge in opioid deaths and medical practitioners are struggling to keep up with it. 

On Wall Street, Ian Fishback was undone by his own mind and the health care system failed him miserably. There&#39;s a new trend of &quot;effective altruism&quot; that has led to a little-known Wall Street firm getting more recognition.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
