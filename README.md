<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, some pretty big news has erupted. Microsoft hired Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, after the company rejected his return. Meanwhile, Argentina just elected a far-right president, and the former first lady Rosalynn Carter recently passed away at 96.  Along with these larger news stories, there are some smaller scale things happening in terms of human rights - U.S. businesses are making workers sign contracts that require them to pay up if they decide to quit their jobs. As for climate change, renewable energy is rising quickly while the energy mix still favours fossil fuels. Lastly, President Biden&#39;s upcoming 81st birthday has people on both sides of the aisle reflecting on plans for next year&#39;s election. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
