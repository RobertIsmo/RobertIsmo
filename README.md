<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world, business is keeping up with the legal consequences of a media firm&#39;s unflattering internal messages. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Iran made a historic agreement to reset their relations. In Ukraine, there has been an escalation of shelling in one northeast town, leading to calls for evacuation. The Treasury Secretary has spoken out to reassure people of the safety of the banking sector in the US due to a Silicon Valley bank collapse. In Turkey, families are turning to the use of fingerprints, DNA, and photos to find missing earthquake victims. In Ohio, the band kids at a rural high school dream of leaving yet worry what they will be leaving behind. A special Georgia grand jury has interviewed a little-known lawyer and Trump ally who previously spread false election claims. The Oscars 2023 movie award night is rapidly approaching and viewers are curious which celebrities will be attending. Finally, there was some exciting news this week on Notre Dame&#39;s sound renovation, Hollywood&#39;s Judy Blume getting her first “yes” from Netflix, and the rise of designer ice.</p>
