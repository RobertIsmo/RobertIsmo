<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of newsworthy events happening in the world recently. In Russia, there was a rebellion over the weekend that reportedly unfolded over 36 hours. Vladimir Putin may also face backlash from an individual who he created, named Yevgeny V. Prigozhin. Here in the US, Donald Trump is steering donations to a political action committee that covers his legal fees, and he&#39;s currently trying to appeal to evangelical Christians in the country by representing himself as some form of Christian crusader. Artificial intelligence is being used more for elections without regulations in place to protect its use, which could be dangerous. There&#39;s also been a tragic case where one man has been charged with murder for trying to save his friend from an overdose. In New York City, officials are helping mentally ill homeless people get access into permanent housing. Saudi Arabia is seeing a newfound interest from evangelicals as tourists and Taiwan has started its own #MeToo movement due to Netflix content. Bangladesh&#39;s water crisis could have implications for other parts of the world as it struggles with climate change and Japan&#39;s Hokusai art has influenced many artists today such as Gauguin and Lichtenstein. Lastly, if you&#39;re ever looking for plans on the weekends, The Weekender offers ideas like how to spend 36 hours exploring Paris or checking out Barbie’s Dreamhouse!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
