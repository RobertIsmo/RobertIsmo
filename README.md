<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some really wild weather events happening right now in California. People who are homeless are having a particularly difficult time dealing with the rains and trying to stay safe. In other news, there was a disruption in air travel across the U.S. recently when the F.A.A failed. A 5-year-old boy is missing after being swept away during floods in California and people are searching for him. There was also a division in Congress over creating a committee to scrutinize the government&#39;s efforts to target conservatives. And nurses in New York City are on strike at two hospitals creating chaotic scenes.

In entertainment news, the Golden Globes were televised this past weekend and TV stars were enlisted as part of an industry effort to oppose climate action. And finally, Montana is in the spotlight lately as it has shifted toward Christian Nationalism in its politics.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
