<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, a lot is going on in the world. In particular, there have been many natural disasters across the globe. For example, earthquake victims in many countries have experienced a night of fear and chaos. Diplomatic efforts are also ongoing and there has been recent discussion of recently-imposed sanctions in Vietnam for its plan to buy Russian weapons. On the American political front, there has been a recent Appeals Court ruling against restrictions on the Biden administration’s social media platforms. In addition, the U.S. Open Singles Championship is underway with Novak Djokovic and Daniil Medvedev competing for the title; Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka are playing for the women&#39;s championship title. Finally, a new book about Elon Musk has revealed some insight into his complex personality.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
