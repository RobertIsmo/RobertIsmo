<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey! There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Trump&#39;s legal team is undergoing some changes and reporters are being barred from bringing phones and laptops to his hearing. In business news, people have been revenge spending on things like hotels and airplane tickets during the pandemic, and car prices overall have been steadily declining. On the stock market front, stocks are climbing higher into a bull market since hitting a low in February. Elsewhere in the world, Ukrainian forces are defending their cities against Russian aggression and thousands of Indian women have been abandoned by husbands when they moved abroad seeking work. In New York City, you can check out loads of great places to eat this summer and there have been some heated proceedings surrounding Rikers Jail Complex. Finally, the Denver Nuggets just won their first ever N.B.A. Championship and archaeologists are uncovering ancient medical tools in Hungary from Roman doctors. Wow!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
