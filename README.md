<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is tension between the U.S. and Russia as Victory Day in Russia is toned down this year due to the war in Ukraine. In Congress, President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy are discussing the debt limit and potential spending cuts as a possible default looms. In the stock market, Wall Street is anxiously preparing for a debt ceiling showdown, while some people are looking at ways to work around it. 

In health news, the U.S. Panel has just recommended that women should start getting regular mammograms at 40 instead of 50 as previously thought. In politics, CIA spymaster William Burns is set to gain more power due to his role in supporting Ukraine. On a completely different note in Florida, social studies textbooks have been rejected and changes were made based on topics like Black Lives Matter and kneeling during the anthem. 

New York is changing how they teach children to read following half of children in grades three to eight failing reading tests. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a tech cold war between China and the U.S., where wireless carriers in many states have had to remove Chinese equipment which has turned out to be costly and difficult. On the other end of things, the Westminster Dog Show just wrapped up with a Samoyed falling short as best in show for two years in a row. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
