<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot happening in the world recently! In the US, Republican Kevin McCarthy just won the speakership after making some concessions to the hard right. This has raised new fears about a possible debt limit standoff. There have also been developments in the tech world - A.I. investment has been booming, and apparently a 20-year-old digital camera is making a comeback with Gen Z. Over in Ukraine, they&#39;re trying to build the perfect grenade, while in a celebratory move, people gathered there for Orthodox Christmas at a holy site traditionally tied to Moscow. Unfortunately, violence was reported as well when a 6-year-old shot their teacher at an elementary school in Virginia, leaving them with life-threatening injuries. Scientists are now concerned about an emerging Covid variant, while people are debating if they should take an antiviral medicine known as Paxlovid if they are mildly ill. Finally, there&#39;s the trial of Sayfullo Saipov who is facing the death penalty for his attack on a bike path back in 2017 - Biden had campaigned against capital punishment but Garland is continuing the case regardless.</p>

<h3>Speaker Quest Reveals McCarthy’s Tenuous Grip on an Unruly Majority</h3>

<p>As the Republican leader has made concessions to the far right, he has effectively agreed to give them carte blanche to disrupt the workings of the House — and to hold him hostage to their demands.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3imfW1R"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
