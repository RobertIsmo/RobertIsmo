<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a lot of tension between the US and China due to a spy balloon dispute. In Munich, people have a feeling that the world is becoming more fractured. A Ukrainian teacher saw violence from Russia first hand and was given a rifle and bullets to help protect her home. Former president Jimmy Carter has chosen hospice care at 98 years old. Climate change is making things like tampons more expensive for consumers. The US Coast Guard is holding one of the most difficult rescue training programs in the world in Washington in choppy waters. Political parties are pushing to make changes to social security and Medicare programs in order to save them, and Michigan GOP has appointed an election denier leader. Mall owners are now trying to bring apartments into malls as part of their live-work-play model strategy. In New Jersey, there&#39;s a small time grift with a basketball game of chance happening on the boardwalks, and New York state has lots of jobs opening up in the cannabis industry. Lastly, the Weekender is offering 25 essential dishes to eat in Paris, alongside other entertainment.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
