<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The Republican candidates for the US presidency have been following Donald J. Trump&#39;s lead and taking aim at core American institutions such as the justice system, military, and schools, which has resulted in a great deal of distrust among voters. Prosecutors have asked for a protective order for one of the Jan. 6 cases and recently, former president Donald Trump cheered the defeat of the US women&#39;s soccer team on the world stage. In one of his countersuits, a judge has thrown out Trump&#39;s case against E. Jean Carroll, who previously said he raped her. The state of Ohio is having an election to amend the state constitution concerning abortion rights and there have been accusations from people close to Cuomo that his sister has been working to smear accusers of him in silence. A Black dancer and Coreographer named O&#39;Shae Sibley was recently shot and killed nine times by border patrol agents in Arizona on tribal lands, which has caused an uproar among many residents. Yellow trucking company recently filed for bankruptcy after receiving $700 million in pandemic relief and movie director William Friedkin, who directed &#39;The French Connection&#39; and &#39;Exorcist&#39; died at 87 years old this past week. Lastly, climate change has become a large culture war issue right now and it&#39;s presence can be felt more and more everyday.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
