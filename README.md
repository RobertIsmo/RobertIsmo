<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia is warning the US that an Israeli invasion of Gaza could have catastrophic consequences for the region&#39;s stability. Hamas is being accused of stockpiling fuel, food, medicine and weapons in tunnels underneath Gaza while Gazans are struggling to find basic necessities like food and water. Satellite images show the extent of damage inflicted on Gaza by the situation. 

Meanwhile, in America, there is growing scrutiny about Adidas&#39; decade-long relationship with Kanye West and his increasingly controversial comments. In New York City, there is concern about a 258-year-old mansion and the bureaucratic neglect that has allowed it to fall apart.

In the tech space, Elon Musk has been making waves after taking control of X platform and Twitter this past year. Many people have left X due to the increase in harmful content, while some sports fans find Twitter indispensable for keeping up with news. 

Closer to home in China, citizens are mourning the death of their former premier Li Keqiang - as well as a period of greater economic opportunity he represented - despite a number of cultural differences between how they pay homage compared to Western cultures.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
