<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the economy is heating up! The Fed is meeting for the first time this year and looks to be raising interest rates, which could affect the stock market and investors. Meanwhile, eurozone inflation has dropped in recent months, but isn&#39;t showing any sign of stopping altogether yet.

At home, it&#39;s been a tough week. A video surfaced of police officers beating a man in Memphis, Tyre Nichols; he later died from his injuries and his funeral will be held soon. President Biden recently met with Kevin McCarthy from the House to discuss the debt limit and both sides still seem to be far apart.

In terms of health, vaccine makers have been keeping billions of dollars in prepayments for canceled COVID shots, while scientists are suggesting that women consider removing their fallopian tubes as a cancer prevention measure - something that doesn&#39;t come without risks. Lastly, oil giants have seen a surge in profits but don&#39;t want to commit to overspending due to economic and military uncertainty in the world.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
