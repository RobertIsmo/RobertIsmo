<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There is a lot of news lately about negotiating and dealing with debt-related issues around the world. In the US, there seems to be an ongoing discussion about cleaning up some Cold War-era radioactive waste, and whether or not this can be resolved in a way that is beneficial to everyone. In Europe, subsidies are being used to draw companies to produce electric vehicles in the US.

On a different note, climate shocks are making parts of America uninsurable, while negotiations over pipelines are creating friction between climate activists and lawmakers. Also, the Arctic region is creating risk for trade routes due to climate change, while tankers are trying to deceive American insurance providers by faking their locations.

In Turkey there has been an uptick with anti-LGBTQ sentiment after the reelection campaign by President Erdogan, while in Ireland fishermen are worried about their industry disappearing due to changes in quotas after Brexit. 

Finally, a bit more on the culture side: The James Beard Foundation has created new processes for rooting out problematic nominees for awards, and there was an exciting fashion show at the High School of Fashion Industries recently!</p>

<h3>Debt Deal Includes a Green Light for a Contentious Pipeline</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
