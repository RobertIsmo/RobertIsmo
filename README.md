<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is dealing with a lot of different issues and people have different opinions on how to address them. On the climate front, President Biden recently approved an big oil project in Alaska, but he&#39;s since curtailed fossil fuel activities on millions of acres of public land. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams has been speaking out about the migrant crisis and asking for federal help. On the political front, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell&#39;s health issues have been worrying Democrats, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested sexism is behind calls for Senator Dianne Feinstein to step aside. Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has been under scrutiny due to his role in busing migrants to other cities. In other news, Peter Navarro recently was convicted of contempt of Congress over a Jan. 6 subpoena, and GOP presidential candidates DeSantis and Ramaswamy have caused controversy by calling the Proud Boys&#39; sentences ‘excessive’ and ‘wrong’. Looking at health, Covid continues to rise around the country but experts remain optimistic about new vaccines nearing release. Lastly, there’s been advice about when and how to wear masks as well as holding off on getting covid booster shots till a new formulation is ready.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
