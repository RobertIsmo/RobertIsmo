<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
My friend, it looks like in the world right now we&#39;re seeing some scrutiny over President Vladimir V. Putin&#39;s stagecraft in Russia. There&#39;s a lot of interest in Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of a mercenary group named Wagner, and there are questions about how mutiny attempts will be handled. 

Meanwhile, in the United States, the Supreme Court is tackling issues with elections and corporate suits. There was also recently a mother who went to court after her son was killed in a mass shooting. Another issue over here is the push to reinstate police officers in schools, which critics say will disproportionately affect students of color. 

The Biden administration is also facing inquiries over Hunter Biden&#39;s handling of certain cases, while President Biden remains determined to stand by his son. Finally, scientists have warned that a new three-body problem may result in global races for new armaments and thermonuclear war.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
