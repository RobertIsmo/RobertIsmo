<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been ongoing tension between the United States and global economies due to the need for lawmakers to reach a bipartisan agreement to lift the debt limit, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning of potential catastrophe if it isn&#39;t solved soon. At the same time, there is political unrest in Texas over gun regulation following a series of mass killings in the state, and a writers&#39; strike in Hollywood that could last for months. Internationally, Ukrainian forces are turning off-the-shelf drones into deadly weapons to combat Russian power, and Russia is planning a muted Victory Day celebration on Tuesday due to fears of attacks or unrest. Lastly, China&#39;s foreign minister is urging Washington to reflect following the downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon in February.</p>

<h3>We Hit the Debt Limit. What Happens Now?</h3>

<h3>What Would the G.O.P. Plan Actually Do to the Budget?</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
