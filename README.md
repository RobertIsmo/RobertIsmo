<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of news stories coming out of around the world right now. In the US, a jury has acquitted a deputy who failed to confront the Parkland gunman. Schools in Denver have brought back police to their campuses despite controversy over racial justice decisions. Meanwhile, a mayor has compared an elderly Holocaust survivor to a plantation owner after she questioned him about rent increases.

We&#39;re also feeling the effects of dangerous heat and wildfire smoke across North America - Canada&#39;s even enlisted firefighters from around the globe to help put out raging fires. On the international front, Russia is making headlines as Vladimir Putin is posing for selfies and possibly detaining a top general while there is concern about their mercenary groups&#39; activities in Africa. 

The US Vice President recently visited Ukraine and there are protests in France over a 17-year-old&#39;s death by police officer. This is all putting Macron under pressure as he&#39;s trying to restore order after his pension overhaul. Lastly, show game shows still remain popular in broadcast TV formats despite streaming becoming more prevalent.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
