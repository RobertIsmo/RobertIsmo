<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, tension between the U.S. and Israel seems to be easing with Biden having invited Netanyahu to a visit. There are plans in Israel to reduce the power of the Supreme Court and that could be voted on soon. Here in the U.S., Trump and his allies are working on plans to increase presidential power come 2025 and Republican presidential candidate Ramaswamy is looking to highlight conservative views through Supreme Court nominees. Meanwhile, Canadian wildfires have blanketed several states with smoke pollution, causing dangerous air quality levels in some areas, while a heat wave is also persisting in the South and West. Lastly, Edward Caban has just become the first Latino Police Commissioner of New York City.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
