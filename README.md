<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like climate change is really hitting home for many people. Vermont recently experienced devastating floods linked to climate change, and there&#39;s even a lack of comprehensive data and maps in the US when it comes to preparing for storms intensified by climate change. At the same time, in the international world, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan might be attempting to mend ties with the Biden administration by scaling back close ties with Russia. Meanwhile, protests have broken out in response to plans by Israel&#39;s governing coalition to limit the power of its Supreme Court. And in the US, former President Trump is still making news; his lawyers are asking for an indefinite postponement of a trial related to documents, he&#39;s picking fights in Iowa (despite 2024 consequences), and his legal team is trying to avoid &quot;smoke and mirrors&quot; in their online fund-raising. On a lighter note, Mattel enlisted Greta Gerwig to write a summer blockbuster as part of their new wave of brand-extension movies. We&#39;re also hearing about the resolution of a family dispute over Aretha Franklin&#39;s estate involving a handwritten will found in her couch after her death, and an A.I. start-up that&#39;s striving to prevent an A.I. apocalypse while competing with ChatGPT.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
