<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. US President Biden recently gave a blistering speech condemning former President Trump as a dire threat to democracy. The Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to Idaho&#39;s strict abortion ban, and legislatures across the country are introducing a number of abortion laws since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Wayne LaPierre, the longtime leader of the National Rifle Association, resigned before facing trial in Manhattan. Former top editor of The New York Times Joseph Lelyvehl passed away at age 86. In Iran, terrorism has exposed a vulnerability the government doesn&#39;t want to admit. In Israel, there is pressure mounting as an Israeli minister proposed a plan for post-war Gaza and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken returned to the Middle East to ease escalating tensions. There is also an election taking place in Bangladesh, where Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to secure her fourth consecutive term after the opposition boycotted what they have deemed an unfair election. Lastly, the Supreme Court is deciding whether or not to disqualify Trump from his office due to his role in the insurrection at Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
