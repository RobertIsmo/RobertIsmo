<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! A recent poll found wide disapproval of President Biden&#39;s policy toward Gaza, with many divided between wanting a peaceful end to the conflict and wanting Israel to have the upper hand. Biden&#39;s rating is especially low with young voters. In Israel, security concerns are driving voters away from the left and towards the right. Meanwhile, Russia is flouting international tech bans by obtaining components for their economy and weapons through secretive middlemen. There was also a powerful earthquake in China recently that left residents huddling together in subzero temperatures with no homes to return to. Google has just allowed more options for paying apps in order to reach a legal settlement, and artists continue to tackle the complexities of making movies about the Holocaust. Oh, and there was also an Icelandic volcano that erupted recently.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
