<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, Donald Trump has been targeted in a special counsel investigation into the Capitol attack on January 6th, and he could face potential charges of obstruction and fraud. In Michigan, 16 people are facing felony charges in a false elector scheme to overturn Trump&#39;s 2020 loss. Meanwhile in Phoenix, they have broken a heat record set in 1974 pushing many across North America, Europe, and Asia to struggle with extreme temperatures. Al Gore is warning about the impact of fossil fuels and how it is causing increased heat waves. In Florida, gubernatorial candidate DeSantis is on CNN defending his campaign while a new $40 million ad campaign has been launched by a super PAC to support Senator Tim Scott&#39;s presidential bid. Additionally, two politicians in Joe Manchin III and former Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. are trying to form a third political party with plenty of disagreements about their views including climate and guns. Lastly, Rex Heuermann who is charged with murder for the Gilgo Beach case will have his wife stand trial in New York as apparently unknowing of the situation - even though she was away when it happened. Last but not least, Hollywood is currently shut down after their actors and writers went on strike but surprisingly their directors actually agreed on a deal with the studios last month.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
