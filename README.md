<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The US government has just proposed that schools must not &quot;categorically&quot; ban transgender athletes from playing sports, in an effort to increase inclusivity. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of a transgender female athlete, who had been banned from joining the girls&#39; track team at her West Virginia middle school.

In other parts of the world, Chinese and French leaders have called for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, while tensions between the two countries remain high. In Tennessee, two Democratic lawmakers were expelled from the House after a protest over gun control. At the same time, Nashville is grieving over a recent school shooting that has highlighted divisions between rural and urban, left and right.

Back in the US, Donald Trump is still making headlines even though he&#39;s out of office. A federal judge overseeing one of his cases recently objected to his harsh rhetoric towards her family, and Trump&#39;s finances are now being investigated by a former Manhattan prosecutor. The US government recently acknowledged that they should have started evacuating Afghanistan sooner as opposed to when President Biden set to end the war in August. Finally, politicians are calling for tighter ethics codes in light of revelations about Justice Thomas accepting trips from a conservative donor without disclosing them. 

In sports news, Augusta National played an easy opening round of its first Masters Tournament of the LIV Golf era, concluding with three PGA Tour and LIV players tied at the top.</p>

<h3>School Sports Cannot ‘Categorically’ Ban Transgender Athletes Under New Biden Proposal</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software.
