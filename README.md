<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things seem to be a bit all over the place. Ukraine is in the middle of a major conflict, with people all over the country sending texts expressing fear, anger, and love amid explosions and other chaos. This has caused global ripple effects that have changed lives and upended economies all over the world. Meanwhile back in the United States, California is being hit by a rare blizzard with power outages impacting Michigan as well, while the Fed&#39;s inflation gauge is picking up speed and stock prices are sinking for the third straight week. In Ohio, Senator J.D. Vance is under pressure following a train derailment, and in New York City there&#39;s a nasty (but small) newspaper war going on - but at least there&#39;s also a sea turtle rehabilitation center where patients can enjoy squid snacks. And finally if you want some more positive news from the US, 2,000 Black skiers recently celebrated a milestone together out on the slopes of Vail!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
