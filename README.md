<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To catch my friend up on the news, there have been some significant changes in the US law recently. Sandra Day O&#39;Connor, the first female appointed to the US Supreme Court, passed away at 93. Her rulings around abortion, affirmative action and voting rights have since been overturned by a more right-leaning court. There was also a special election in New York due to a Republican being expelled from Congress after lies about his personal finances and campaigns came to light. 

On an international level, Israel has been experiencing conflict in Gaza and there have been calls from the US for restraint. In terms of oil production, the US has hit record levels but it has caused alarm with environmental activists and at a climate summit this month in Dubai. Meanwhile, stocks have found a new high for the year after dropping over summer and there have been several protests against the Federal Reserve Chair for not doing enough to address climate change. Finally, 2023 was probably one of the best years for movies yet, although they all seemed to reflect a pessimistic outlook overall.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
