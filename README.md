<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like there&#39;s a lot going on right now. US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is facing an ouster bid from Representative Gaetz, and Democrats are weighing whether they should rescue him. Over in New York, former President Donald Trump is going through a fraud trial with New York&#39;s Attorney General Letitia James accusing him of fraud. Meanwhile there&#39;s a big antitrust case against Google with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as the government&#39;s biggest-name witness. The UN just approved a Kenyan security mission to Haiti to combat gang violence. And Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken was recently revealed to be a guitar geek! On top of all that, Russian spy agencies are reportedly targeting US support for Ukraine, and the EU just held a surprise summit in Kyiv.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
