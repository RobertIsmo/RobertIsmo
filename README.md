<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. In the United States, there is an ongoing strike between the car companies and their workers which is thought to help underscore President Biden&#39;s policy positions. Furthermore, the Biden administration is attempting to make it harder for President Trump to fire civil service workers should he be elected for a second term. Elsewhere, Congress is melting down over spending debates just days away from a potential shutdown. 

In other news, there are mysterious rumors out of China regarding their defense minister who has not been seen in weeks, which point towards the potential of high-level upheaval in their military. The Chinese economy is also struggling evidenced by consumer spending and falling prices of apartment&#x2F;construction rates.

Roughly speaking, illegal mopeds and fake identities comprise something of an underground economy in New York City as new migrants gain whatever money they can by any means necessary with regard to employment restrictions. Additionally, there have been escalating protests due to influx of migrants in regards to Staten Island involving heckling, suing and cursing. 

Also overseas, a Muslim cleric reflects on his experience during wartime while trying to escape Russian forces and ultimately settling on working as a medic at the front line. A notable businessman known as Sam Bankman-Fried has also recently been under investigation with hundreds of pages being written from him during his house arrest for self-justification. Finally and tragically, famed painter and sculptor Fernando Botero has passed away at 91 while his voluptuous figures leave an ever-lasting impression in art galleries around the globe. Lastly, the daughter of a notorious serial killer known as B.TK., Kerri Rawson visits her father in prison for the first time in order to help investigators with more potential cases.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
