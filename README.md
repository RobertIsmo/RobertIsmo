<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some serious issues going on right now in the world. In Mexico, 43 students were kidnapped by a drug gang over a decade ago, and authorities recently revealed that the police, military officers, and others had secretly worked with the cartel. President Biden is also in Florida touring the area after Hurricane Idalia hit, and getting criticism from Republicans. Elsewhere, Ukraine is working towards a counteroffensive backed by hundreds of assault groups, while Biden&#39;s &quot;Bidenomics&quot; policies are worrying Democrats. There&#39;s also drama going on with TikTok in Montana and at the U.S. Open in New York with their hardcourt surfaces. Lastly, Bill Richardson, a Champion of Americans Held Overseas passed away recently at 75 while Jimmy Buffett passed away at 76 after becoming a millionaire many times over through his popular songs.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
