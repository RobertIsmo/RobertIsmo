<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot is happening in the world. In the US, Republicans are considering launching impeachment proceedings against President Biden for his border policies, and former President Trump won&#39;t be at the July 4th parades. At a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Putin, Xi and Modi met on camera but without signs of greater unity. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia and Fort Worth, shootings have left eight people dead and two injured in the last few days. On the international stage, Putin is trying to rein in rebels who oppose him while also giving cash rewards to members of his own elite circle. Lastly, fireworks have become a political hot topic as fire concerns and air quality mount.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
