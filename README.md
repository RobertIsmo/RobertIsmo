<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In China, an effort by the government to enlist its citizens in helping to guard against foreign enemies has blurred the line between vigilance and paranoia. This comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping has recently consolidated power by dismantling the guardrails that were designed to prevent another Mao from rising to power. In Mexico, police, military officers, and other authorities have reportedly colluded with a powerful cartel behind a mass abduction of 43 students from an unsolved case nearly 10 years later, which text messages are helping to uncover. In the US, Bill Richardson – a former governor of New Mexico and diplomat – recently passed away at 75. He left behind a legacy of having worked to secure the release of Americans held overseas. Also in the US, famed singer Jimmy Buffett has died at 76 after creating songs that have become folk legends such as “Margaritaville” and “Cheeseburger in Paradise”, among others. His influence on style is undeniable. On the other hand, California&#39;s Oceanside city is facing the harsh reality of rising sea levels and man-made projects that are causing their beach space to vanish quickly – an issue that can be devastating for a city that claims coastal life as part of its identity. Finally, in South Africa, officials were warned multiple times about dangers posed by a derelict building where 76 people lost their lives in a fire just this week.</p>

<h3>China to Its People: Spies Are Everywhere, Help Us Catch Them</h3>

<p>As Beijing tries to enlist the “whole of society” to guard against foreign enemies, the line between vigilance and paranoia fades.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/46dIs9l"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Why Did a Drug Gang Kill 43 Students? Text Messages Hold Clues.</h3>

<p>The Mexican police, military officers and others secretly colluded with a cartel that kidnapped 43 students, a case unsolved after nearly a decade.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
