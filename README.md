<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a rift among Europe and the United States about whether to send F-16s. Heat levels are soaring to record highs across the world for the next five years, which could have far-reaching consequences. The United States military recently caught an airman mishandling secrets before his arrest yet he stayed in his job. In Texas, there is a bill just passed by their legislature that bans transgender medical care for children - though it is likely to get signed into law. In response to Jakarta’s unsustainable future, Indonesia’s president is working on creating a new capital city from scratch. Montana has signed a total ban of TikTok and other governments are voicing their concerns about it potentially putting user data at risk. Researchers have created a “digital twin” of the Titanic that provides stunning details to give insight into what could have happened to it when it sunk in 1912. Prince Harry and Meghan were chased by paparazzi in New York, resembling the chase that killed Harry’s mother, though the situation was more complex. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank is paying out money to victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Leon Botstein (the President of Bard College) acknowledges receiving $150,000 from a foundation created by Jeffrey Epstein - though he donated it if as part of a $1 million gift he gave in 2016. Lastly, South Carolina’s House has passed an abortion ban that would last six weeks - bringing both chambers closer to agreement on this ban after months of debate.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
