<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are getting really tense between Israel and Palestine. Several airstrikes and ground fighting have been reported. In Illinois, a 6-year-old Muslim boy was tragically attacked and murdered, which has been linked to the Mideast conflict. In the US politics, a republican lawmaker named Jim Jordan from Ohio is gradually becoming closer to taking the speaker office in the US House of Representatives, although some of his party members are still opposing him. A few weeks ago, former President Trump was ordered by a judge to observe a limited gag order in an election case. Lastly, thousands of migrant families who were separated at the border by the Trump administration have just reached a major settlement and may be allowed to live and work in the US with temporary permission - if they win asylum, they even could become citizens.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
