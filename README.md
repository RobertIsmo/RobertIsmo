<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like some of the leading countries in the world are really trying to make changes to protect the environment and compete with China. The G7 countries are planning to spend trillions to green-ify the economy, while also stealing away some of China&#39;s manufacturing power. On a more somber note, President Biden recently paid tribute to victims of the Hiroshima bombing, bringing up issues of nuclear weapons security around the world. In Greece, there is controversy over video evidence that appears to show asylum seekers being rounded up and abandoned on a raft by the Greek Coast Guard. And in other news, Donald Trump&#39;s ally could face perjury charges if he doesn&#39;t cooperate with an impending prosecution in New York, and Amazon is taking some heat due to its new size and monopolistic power. Meanwhile, there is an exciting development in technology in America; semiconductor companies are hiring thousands more employees thanks to federal dollars. On a smaller scale, researchers have been investigating why we even listen to sad songs when they bring us down (it apparently connects us emotionally with others). In California, some people think Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been in office too long due to her ill health while others sympathize with her. To make matters worse, she is reported to have suffered more complications from her illness than was publicly disclosed. Another sad situation around America is that it doesn&#39;t appear that police officers are wearing body cameras - this lack of video footage certainly hasn&#39;t helped clamor surrounding an activist who was killed by Georgia police officers. On a happier note, Brittney Griner has returned to professional basketball after her detention in Russia! She&#39;s using her increased platform to make serious changes for women&#39;s sports.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
