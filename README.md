<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, the House of Representatives is in chaos after a historic vote to remove the Speaker of the House. This is being seen as a reflection of a struggle to govern an increasingly polarizing and ungovernable Republican majority in Congress. Meanwhile, there are questions about Rudy Giuliani&#39;s drinking and his role in Donald Trump&#39;s federal election interference case, and Senator Robert Menendez faces prosecution for a secretive fatal car crash involving his soon-to-be wife. On a global scale, there are tensions over Tibetan Buddhism, set to come to a head when its leader dies, and there is a fight to save Gagauz - an ethnic language used by dwindling numbers of people in Moldova. Finally, newly arrived migrants in New York City have taken to selling goods on the street, leading to turf battles with more established vendors. This week three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on quantum dots.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
