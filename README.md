<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening in the world right now! In the US, representatives Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan are running for speaker in the House of Representatives, after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. McCarthy stepped down because the Republican majority refused to be governed. Meanwhile, Donald Trump&#39;s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani has come under investigation related to Trump&#39;s case over 2020 election interference. Student loan payments have also recently resumed after a three-year pause, and some students are due for a fresh start. Also, there&#39;s an ongoing trial involving the FTX founder who is accused of lying to cryptocurrency trading customers. Finally, a missing 9 year old girl was found in New York after a lucky break by police officers!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
