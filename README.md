<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening both in the US and around the world. In Russia, President Putin spoke out against a rebellion that was led by his former ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Meanwhile, Biden and Putin had dueling messages about this event. In the US, a plan for congestion pricing in New York City has finally cleared its last hurdle, meaning drivers will soon have to pay to enter Midtown Manhattan. Unfortunately, it&#39;s been unbearably hot in Texas and Oklahoma recently, resulting in the tragic deaths of a teen and her stepfather on a hike due to heat exhaustion. This dangerous heatwave is expected to move eastward this week and blanket areas from Arizona to Alabama. In other news, a judge denied a request to seal the witness list in the Trump documents case, which may reveal some interesting information. Lastly, Jenna Lyons and celebrities Mark Ruffalo and Wendell Pierce are fighting against plans to demolish a historically significant church in Manhattan and turn it into condos. Finally, we’ve learned about the passing of Richard Ravitch who devotedly saved the subways and New York City’s finances back in the 1970s.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
