<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is currently having to navigate many complex situations. China is facing economic difficulties which could potentially have an effect on the U.S., and U.S. policymakers are trying to find ways to strike a balance with China. Trump and his co-defendants in Georgia are clashing in court. Bob Barker, a famous television host, died at 99. FIFA has suspended a Spanish soccer federation chief for their involvement in a post-game kiss. A Millennial candidate by the name of Vivek Ramsawmy is running for office in the United States and has gotten some attention due to fact-checking around his campaign trail claims. A singer of the popular song &quot;Rich Men North of Richmond&quot; has stated that it was not intended as a Republican anthem. Bird watchers are searching for a rare species known as the Nemesis bird, while more exotic birds have started showing up in New York City. Lastly, Ukraine is still dealing with a battlefield left behind by a Russian contractor, while Russia is looking into ways to gradually bring the private military group led by this contractor under its control.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
