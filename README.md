<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of changes happening in the world right now. In Mexico, their election agency is being hobbled just ahead of the 2024 presidential election, which is part of a larger pattern of challenges to democratic institutions across the western hemisphere. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin and President Biden made dueling appearances recently to shore up alliances - an act that had to do with the ongoing Cold War tensions between them. Speaking of Russia, there was a celebration of war and national unity in Moscow recently, while Ukraine has launched multiple strikes deep behind enemy lines in their port city of Mariupol amidst the ongoing conflict. Closer to home, Donald Trump&#39;s former right-wing supporters are now under subpoena for the Jan. 6 investigation and one former Proud Boy even stated the group was planning an &#39;all-out revolution.&#39; Even more concerning, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have also been subpoenaed as part of this probe. 

On top of all this, business confidence in China has taken a hit due to one tech rainmaker mysteriously vanishing and there are reports that within your gut exists an entire complex wild world full of mysteries that experts are just starting to delve into. Lastly, Plains, Georgia has been keeping vigil for their hometown hero and former President Jimmy Carter who recently entered hospice care.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
