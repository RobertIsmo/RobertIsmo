<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey there friend! Despite the pandemic, a lot of stuff is happening in the world right now. In the tech space, people have been becoming increasingly aware of the risks of artificial intelligence, so much so that some of the same people who were most afraid of it decided they should be the ones to build it. There&#39;s also been a big emphasis on using A.I. to fight climate change - though this comes with its own issues since the energy required to do this could actually end up making matters worse. 

In terms of international conflict, a recent war between Israel and Gaza has been taking place which has had mothers in Israel grappling with anxiety as their sons head off to fight. Meanwhile, Ireland has been displaying a hefty level of support for Palestinians by condemning Hamas attacks and speaking out against the conflict. Stateside we&#39;re seeing a Supreme Court ruling that may determine whether or not organizations get permanent immunity from future opioid lawsuits in exchange for payments up to $6 billion. 

On top of that, President Trump (who is still being charged after trying to overturn an election) is now trying to paint Joe Biden as a bigger threat despite all his anticdemocratic promises in a second term. And lastly, &#39;medical freedom&#39; activists are trying to get rid of childhood vaccine mandates in Mississippi while we&#39;ve seen an influx of Venezuelan migrants creating what could be New York&#39;s first &#39;Little Caracas&#39;. 

That&#39;s all I got!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
