<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. We are facing some huge environmental issues, especially when it comes to climate change. The US government has just announced the first drugs it has picked to be put up for price negotiation as part of its inflation reduction program. There is also a storm threatening to move through the Southeast and there is worry that heavy rain could stir up potentially toxic algae blooms in lakes like Lake Okeechobee. On top of all of that, global trade ties with China are still strong and even trying to decouple from them is proving difficult right now. Additionally, there have been reports of a Chinese influence campaign that was recently taken down and the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a plane crash along with nine others. Maritime vessels in Ukraine are being asked to take some risky trips through dangerous waters due to the political tensions with Russia and New York City is trying its best to prevent West Nile virus outbreaks by targeting mosquitos in Queens.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
