<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Police violence in the US has come into sharp focus after videos contradicted initial reports regarding the arrest of Tyre Nichols. Two Memphis police officers were suspended in response. On the international stage, Secretary of State Blinken recently met with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to address deepening rifts between their countries. Meanwhile, the US government is planning to end public health emergency standards due to Covid in May, and Wall Street is figuring out logical solutions to looming debt limit issues. To top it off, prosecutors in NYC have started presenting their case against former President Trump to a grand jury, while Gabrielle Giffords — a Congresswoman severely injured at a mass shooting — continues to lobby for gun safety legislation. Russia&#39;s mercenary army is being composed from prisoners who are getting sent back home with traumatic experiences and training from war. There were also two men who tried to escape Russia by boat in September, and the White House is operating with stringent protocols for handling classified documents and everyday records. Lastly, there&#39;s a lot of talk about detoxing but not necessarily a lot of truth behind it.</p>

<h3>Wall St. Is Counting on a Debt Limit Trick That Could Entail Trouble</h3>

<h3>For Giffords, Progress on Gun Safety Is Like Her Recovery: ‘Inch by Inch’</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
