<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is in a state of flux. In Gaza, there&#39;s an intensifying conflict between Israel and Hamas that&#39;s left many Palestinians facing airstrikes in the north and south.  Meanwhile, Hezbollah and Israel have higher stakes as this conflict continues, with fears of a wider war. In Ukraine, there has been a surge in international arms sales due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the rise of China. There’s also a momentous shift looming in Poland where the governing party is set to be ousted, while Ukraine is using powerful American-made missiles for the first time. In the US, there is an election case involving former president Trump that’s led to a gag order; Black voters have new power in Mississippi and are looking to elect a Democrat; and some people are living in their cars due to not being able to afford rent. Finally, it has been revealed that more than a third of women under 50 are iron-deficient and Alec Baldwin is facing another manslaughter case for an incident on a film set.</p>

<h3>For Hezbollah and Israel, the Stakes in Any Broader War Are High</h3>
<sub>By Ben Hubbard and Aaron Boxerman</sub>
<p>The fighting between Israel and Hamas has raised fears the violence will spill into Lebanon as a wider conflict with Hezbollah.

<h3>Momentous Shift Looms for Poland as Governing Party Looks Set to Be Ousted</h3>
<sub>By Andrew Higgins</sub>

<h3>Black Voters Have New Power in Mississippi. Can They Elect a Democrat?</h3>
<sub>By Nick Corasaniti</sub>
<p>The fall of a Jim Crow-era election law and a restoration of felons’ voting rights have given Black voters new sway in the state.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
