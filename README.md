<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of troublesome and heartbreaking stories happening in the world right now. In Gaza, tens of thousands of people are being forced to leave their homes due to a violent conflict between Israel and Hamas. Meanwhile in China, people are worried about their economy and political system, and sending money overseas as a precaution. In the US, CIA Director William J Burns and leaders of Mossad have been meeting in Qatar for talks on hostage releases. On the political front, the Koch network has endorsed Nikki Haley in her bid to succeed Donald Trump as president, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is debating California Governor Gavin Newsom as part of his own presidential campaign. And to honor the late former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, Republicans and Democrats have come together to celebrate her 77-year marriage with former President Jimmy Carter.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
