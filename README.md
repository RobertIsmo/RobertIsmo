<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on right now in the world. President Biden is hosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India for meetings and a state dinner. India is profiting from its neutrality in the Ukraine War, buying huge amounts of Russian oil. Modi&#39;s visit has big implications for U.S.-India relations, as President Biden seeks to shore up an alliance against Russia&#39;s aggression and China&#39;s economic influence. Meanwhile, Belarus is fast becoming a &#39;vassal state&#39; of Russia, and a Wall Street Journal reporter has been detained there and charged with spying. In California, experts are warning that a superstorm could lead to floods. A court is set to reveal who bailed out a first-term GOP congressman, and writers have compiled a list of 25 most influential works of postwar queer literature. Here in the US, the population is older than ever before due to longevity gains, and storms have killed 4 people in North Texas town while heatwave spread across much of the region.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
