<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. A Chinese spy balloon was discovered in the US, and American officials are saying a rival power may be using advanced technology to spy on US military sites. In northern Maine, it&#39;s so cold that they&#39;re getting &quot;frostquakes.&quot; Meanwhile, Democrats have decided to overhaul their primary calendar for the presidential elections and put more diverse states at the front of the line. In Russia, they&#39;re pushing to take control of a Ukrainian town that is near a very important supply line. Over in Big Sur, California, people have been dealing with heavy storms recently and some residents are cut off from the rest of the state. And finally, Pope Francis recently visited South Sudan and encouraged his clergy to not stay neutral about violent acts and injustice.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
