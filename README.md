<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of news going on right now that&#39;s important to stay aware of. On the political side, former president Donald Trump has been accused of tampering with security camera footage in his former residence, Mar-a-Lago. Also, President Biden is overhauling the military justice code, taking away commanders&#39; authority over certain cases. In terms of public safety, New Yorkers are bracing for a second straight day of dangerously high heat and other places are providing tips on how to stay cool. And internationally, people have tried to rally South America behind Ukraine only to nearly get killed in a missile strike and European countries are struggling with how to make Russia pay for the war. On the business front, Wall St.&#39;s pessimists have had to adjust to being wrong about stock index trends. Also, Exxon&#39;s earnings were leaner than usual in the second quarter while Japan&#39;s central bank took a surprise step away from easy money.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
