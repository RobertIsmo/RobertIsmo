<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. U.S. diplomats recently visited Beijing to discuss potential conflict between the U.S. and China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also expressed concerns over possible military support from Chinese companies to Russia. Additionally, there was an attempted assassination of a CIA spy in Russia last year that led to both the agency&#39;s chief in Moscow being expelled and his Russian counterpart in Washington. Furthermore, countries are rushing to arm Ukraine with weapons, but some of them have been too broken to use or not delivered yet. Lastly, Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny is currently on trial again with potential decades of jail time looming over him.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
