<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The US is currently dealing with a lot of news involving politics. Several grand jurors in Georgia are being threatened after their identities were posted on social media. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a lot of activity around an upcoming trial against former president Donald J. Trump. In addition, Hawaii is trying to understand how and why the Maui wildfires have happened and who should be held accountable. Also, mortgages rates in the US have exaggerated, making it hard for people to buy homes. Lastly, Generation X members are facing a challenge since student loan payments have resumed while they try to save for retirement.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
