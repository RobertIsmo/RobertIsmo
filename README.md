<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot going on abroad in multiple regions of the world. In the Philippines, US troops are set to have increased access on four new bases as part of a strategic partnership in the region. Further, China and the US are both vying for influence in Indonesia which is resource-rich and home to nearly 300 million people. Additionally, tensions between Russia and Ukraine are growing as Russia is massing hundreds of thousands of troops by the Ukrainian border. On our home-front, the Federal Reserve recently raised rates due to moderating inflation. The College Board also recently revised its Advanced Placement curriculum for African American Studies and shifted away from critical race theory. Finally, President Biden and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy were just discussing the potential debt limit as a financial crisis seems eminent.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
