<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot happening in the US and around the world. In the US, President Biden is facing increasing pressure from his own party to address the ongoing immigration crisis, with cities and states struggling to support migrants needing shelter and support. On the other side of the nation, Texas has been overwhelmed by a surge of migrants arriving by bus, leading to New York City filing a lawsuit against the bus companies. Meanwhile, Representative Tony Gonzales has gone from being a skeptic of the G.O.P.&#39;s rigorous immigration line to its champion. On top of that, Trump has been using fear and favor tactics to win Republican endorsements. 

Around the world, Islamic State has recently claimed responsibility for deadly bombings in Iran, and Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius, who was convicted of murder, was recently released from prison in South Africa. Red Sea attacks are menacing energy tankers but don&#39;t seem to be interfering as much as expected with trade. Lastly, an interesting court case is set to start in which Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev is accusing Sotheby&#39;s of helping an art dealer scam him out of millions.</p>
