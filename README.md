<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In the US, there have been weeks of damaging storms that has left 19 people dead in California. There are also classified documents that were found at Biden&#39;s house in Wilmington. White House officials are trying to shed more light on the situation. On top of all that, there&#39;s Covid which is still running rampant all over the world with China reporting nearly 60,000 deaths since restrictions were lifted. There&#39;s also a new dominant strain called XBB.1.5 that has been making its way around the northeast and causing a majority of new cases recently. Lastly, outside of the US, there have been some dangerous events like rescuers rushing to save the people buried in a building destroyed by a Russian missile and hunters for truffles having to be careful about their dogs getting poisoned by competitors who are trying to take out this lucrative industry.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
