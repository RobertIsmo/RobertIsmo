<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the Middle East, Gaza&#39;s tunnels have been a source of tension between Israel and Hamas, while in the US, President Biden&#39;s pro-Israel stance has upset some Arab and Muslim American voters in Michigan. Meanwhile, a manhunt in Maine has concluded after a deadly shooting left 18 dead. More articles explore issues of faith, race, and resources in the US and around the world. In India, there is an ongoing series about two young women who are trying to take control of their lives by chasing opportunities there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
