<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, former President Jair Bolsonaro&#39;s supporters in Brazil are causing chaos and ransacking government offices because they falsely believe the election was rigged. In the U.S., Republicans have started a special subcommittee to investigate the FBI and security agencies, while House Democrats are trying to fix Congress but having difficulty. In terms of immigration, Biden just visited the Southern border and El Paso is seeing a surge of migrants due to immigration system breakdowns. Finally, in East Asia, populations are aging quickly, leading to older people working well into their 70s and beyond.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
