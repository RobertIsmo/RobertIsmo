<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening around the world right now! The U.A.W. is on strike against Detroit&#39;s Big 3 automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, across several plants right now which could have big economic consequences. Technology mogul Sam Bankman-Fried is embroiled in a legal battle as he faces criminal charges soon. In politics, House Speaker McCarthy has scrapped plans to pass military spending in the US after tensions over budget levels with far-right Republicans. Meanwhile, Hunter Biden was indicted for gun charges and President Biden is taking aim at Republicans for undercutting working-class Americans. Over in Libya, citizens are dealing with widespread flooding that caused two dams to collapse resulting in thousands of deaths. In a separate but still related development, the US has put sanctions on Russia in response to its military activities in Ukraine while Ukraine is intensifying attacks on Russian forces in Crimea and the Black Sea region. Finally, Ireland has received 10 billion euros in a budget surplus with no clear direction on how to spend it yet – likely leaving some people unhappy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
