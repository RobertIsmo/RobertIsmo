<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there is a lot going on in the world right now. The Federal Reserve has been rapidly raising interest rates to fight inflation, but that could get trickier due to some instability in the banking sector. There&#39;s also international drama involving Russia, with war crimes cases being opened against the country at the International Criminal Court. Closer to home, President Biden recently unveiled a landmark submarine deal with Australia and Britain as part of an effort to counter China. Meanwhile, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo&#39;s plans to build an AirTrain to LaGuardia have officially been scrapped due to ballooning costs. And then of course, we all got to enjoy the Oscars for some lighter news!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
