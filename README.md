<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Turkey, their elections are coming up on Sunday and people are anxious about the outcome. The current president is facing tough competition for the first time in twenty years. Ukraine&#39;s President Zelensky met with the Pope and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni recently to bolster support for his country&#39;s fight against Russia. Germany is investing nearly 3 billion US dollars in aid to Ukraine as part of efforts to reset their rocky relations. In the US, there is a growing issue of homelessness as record numbers of people are dying on the streets. Politically, there are debates over immigration, with both Democrats and Republicans attempting to forge an immigration deal in Congress. Meanwhile, sports betting is becoming increasingly regulated due to harm it can cause to the public and athletes. Finally, Eurovision fans can watch the final show this Saturday!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
