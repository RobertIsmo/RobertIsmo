<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. There is pressure for Harvard&#39;s president to resign after she answered questions about antisemitism. There&#39;s a debate going on about whether anti-zionism is always antisemitic. To complicate matters further, there&#39;s discussion about who is best suited to lead universities. In Israel, a border community near Gaza has been devastated by Hamas-led attacks and now must figure out what comes next. Meanwhile, American pedestrians are dying at night at an alarming rate, with some suggesting it&#39;s linked to climate change. Looking ahead, there are difficulties constructing offshore wind projects in the US; one quarter of freshwater fish are also at risk of extinction due to climate changes; and virtual COP28 Climate Summit is taking place with diplomats and policy talk as well as extra events like a trade fair and light show.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
