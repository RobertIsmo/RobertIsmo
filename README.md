<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In talks with US President Biden, China&#39;s leader Xi Jinping is trying to project both strength and a willingness to engage. Meanwhile in the South China Sea, China has been using force to gain control. In Israel and Palestine, there is a younger generation of peacemakers who are part of the dialogue about what comes after the war and how Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side. 

In Gaza, Israel recently seized a hospital that was being used by Hamas that has put the Middle East on edge. The UN Security Council is trying to help by calling for dayslong humanitarian pauses in Gaza. In Russia and Ukraine, many Ukrainians are leaving Russian occupation to go back into Ukraine, bringing stories of repression. 

Closer to home, there is progress on averting a government shutdown in the US with the Senate passing a bill for stopgap funding. There has also been opposition to the deal between GM and the autoworkers&#39; union and Robert Kennedy Jr. has come under fire for turning some of his crusades into a private windfall. Lastly, African artists are spearheading a cultural Renaissance during this time with digital connections bringing many African diasporas together.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
