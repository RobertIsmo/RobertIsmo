<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In the US, Congress passed a debt limit bill in a bipartisan vote to help avert default. Federal prosecutors have a tape where former President Trump discussed a sensitive document he kept after leaving office, and they&#39;re looking into his handling of classified documents. Meanwhile, Russia denounced the West over a drone strike and there have been more early morning attacks in Kyiv that killed three. In fashion news, there was an amazing &#39;Hogwarts of Fashion&#39; Spring show at the High School of Fashion Industries. And Florida Governor DeSantis is beginning to fire back to months of attacks from former President Trump. In Texas, there&#39;s an ongoing impeachment trial against Attorney General Ken Paxton, and Oklahoma Supreme Court recently ruled new abortion bans unconstitutional. Lastly, there are some fascinating auction pieces coming up with Sotheby&#39;s including Freddie Mercury&#39;s original draft lyrics for &#39;Bohemian Rhapsody&#39;. Wow!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
