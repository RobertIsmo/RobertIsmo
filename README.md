<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things are happening on the domestic front in US and abroad. In the US, the Trump documents case has a tentative trials date set for August while an ethics concern arises around one of his real estate deals in Oman. There is also discussion about different approaches to combat homelessness and handle aid for those facing poverty. On the international front, Ukraine prisoners being released by Russia are describing a harrowing experience with violence and inadequate resources while the US and China differ in how they view the rivalry between them. On top of that, China is taking more economic measures by sometimes controversially cutting key interest rates to hopefully boost its economy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
