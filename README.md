<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To sum up what is happening in the world at this moment, there are a few notable stories. In Hungary, they have blocked Ukraine&#39;s receiving of aid money from the European Union after the E.U opened their door to membership negotiations since their president wanted some more financial aid. Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., they have been urging Israel to scale down their war effort which has resulted in some Gazan cemeteries being destroyed while American reporters have been detained in Russia by Putin. Also, Republicans have rejected funding given to Penn&#39;s veterinary school since it did not take a firmer stance against antisemitism and they passed a defense bill to President Biden. Furthermore, there is an examination of free speech on university campuses and conversations about managing pain associated with IUDs for women. Finally, opinions are hoped for from the Supreme Court that can settle whether or not Trump is convicted criminal with enough time for citizens to know before the election and stories of people suffering long-term effects from Covid-19.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
