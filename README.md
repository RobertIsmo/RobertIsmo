<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some worrying developments happening in the world at the moment. In Israel, Hamas has shocked Iranian leaders with a major attack and there has been evidence of civilian massacres by Hamas terrorists. In the United States, there are Americans missing or killed in Israel, while activists are using Virginia as a dry run ahead of the 2024 election. Supreme Court justices are struggling to disentangle race and politics in South Carolina&#39;s voting districts. China is also the largest oil importer from Saudi Arabia and Iran, highlighting the risk it faces if war in Israel and Gaza were to widen. Financially, natural gas prices have risen due to Israel concerns as well as a pipeline leak in Finland. Investors doubt that central bankers will raise interest rates again due to market moves that could cool growth, and there was an incident where two planes nearly collided in Texas due to air traffic control issues. On the lighter side, breaking will be featured at the upcoming Paris Olympics despite its pioneers not always feeling supported in hip-hop culture.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
