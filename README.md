<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, Ukraine’s Western-trained brigades are beginning to enter the fight in what could be a pivotal moment. Meanwhile, social scientists are starting to understand why more Americans are purchasing guns and how that’s changing their behavior. In the courts, the Supreme Court recently revived Biden immigration guidelines which were blocked by a Texas federal judge, rejected a free speech challenge to an immigration law, and narrowed the right to confront one&#39;s accuser in joint trials. Elsewhere, an expert raised safety concerns after a 2019 trip on Titan and a year since Roe was struck down has shifted how abortion politics takes center stage. Finally, there’s been a new study about room temperature superconductors while Barbie is taking us on a journey to explore her Dreamhouse and the American dream without Ken.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
