<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. The United Auto Workers are on strike, testing Biden&#39;s economic agenda. In Hollywood, actors and writers are in a battle over technology and control. Millions of people are under warnings in New England as Hurricane Lee approaches, and its landfall is expected this weekend. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the FTX, is facing several criminal charges and a small Connecticut city with a Republican mayoral nominee has voted for President Biden. Finally, analysts are exploring why Democrats seem to be losing ground among nonwhite voters.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
