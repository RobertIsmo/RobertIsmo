<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. We have President Biden and his son Hunter facing some politically and personally painful troubles as Hunter has been sentenced in some agreement. Republicans are looking into this which has lead to Democrats arguing for the Justice Department&#39;s independence. Court cases regarding Trump are starting up with a trial date being set for August. There have also been some ethics concerns arising regarding Trump&#39;s real estate dealings in Oman. The Constitution and law are not clear when it comes to what would happen if a presidential candidate was convicted, so that leads us to uncharted territory. A study has come out showing that the cumulative force of head hits is the best predictor of CTE in athletes. Ukrainian prisoners of war have been sharing stories of beatings and inadequate food and health care while held captive. There are some interesting secrets behind the home field advantage in sports, like groups using ban on infield shifts to their advantage. Businesses have been trying various incentives to get employees back into the office, from generous bonuses to charity donations to poor performance evaluations when they don&#39;t show up. Lastly, four people tragically died in a fire near Chinatown which left two others critically injured.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
