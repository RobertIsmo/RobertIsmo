<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of political and cultural issues are being addressed. In the US, Donald Trump&#39;s fraud trial is underway and he&#39;s trying to gain more public support; the Iowa caucuses are coming up and he&#39;s doing events to try and boost his own candidacy. In the world of healthcare, two Covid vaccine pioneers have been awarded the Nobel Prize for their work developing vaccines that were administered to billions around the world. In addition, NASA is looking at creating potential housing on the moon by 2040. On a more controversial note, there&#39;s a trial occurring in the crypto industry and the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is facing a reckoning over his actions. Lastly, the Vatican is gathering bishops along with lay people and women to discuss topics such as married priests and gay couples’ blessings.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
