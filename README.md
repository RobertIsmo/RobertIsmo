<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world! In Ukraine, Russian forces have already captured some of the territory there, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, visited Mariupol despite an international court warrant issued for his arrest. Meanwhile in Iraq, US forces invaded 20 years ago and it&#39;s been difficult to gauge their impact since then. China is trying to position itself as a peacemaker in the Ukraine War but the US and Europe are skeptical of their motives. Closer to home in the US, homelessness is becoming more and more of a crisis and even sandwich shops are feeling the effects. On top of all this, we just found out that former President Donald Trump may be indicted due to possible payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Thankfully however, Princeton University just advanced to the Round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and that&#39;s something to celebrate!</p>

<h3>In U.S.-Led Iraq War, Iran Was the Big Winner</h3>
<sub>By Vivian Yee and Alissa J. Rubin</sub>
<p>In the 20 years since the United States invaded Iraq, Iran has built up loyal militias inside Iraq, gained deep political influence in the country and reaped economic benefits.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
