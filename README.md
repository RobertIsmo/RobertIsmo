<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been really tense in the Middle East between Israel, Egypt and the United States as talks drag on to get aid into Gaza. On top of that, there&#39;s a big divide in the United States as progressive Jews feel abandoned by their left-wing allies and Republicans are digging in against Jordan&#39;s speaker candidacy.

The US is also in the middle of a financial crisis with unexpected tax dips and the federal deficit growing. Meanwhile, Donald Trump&#39;s lawyer Kenneth Chesebro recently pleaded guilty in Georgia with another one of his co-defendants doing the same, and Governor DeSantis&#39;s super PAC is now helping to pay for private flights which may be testing some legal boundaries.

On the global business stage, OpenAI is said to be valuing itself at a staggering $80 billion while US tech companies are clamping down on Chinese chip-making machinery sales. Over at Apple, they&#39;ve just debuted Martin Scorsese&#39;s &#39;Killers of the Flower Moon&#39; which critics are calling an &quot;unsettling masterpiece&quot;. To top it off, Ukraine may be seeking a new front in its war with Russia by conducting raids across the Dnipro river.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
