<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Well, there have been a couple of big stories this week. 

First, in Israel, a hard-line government has taken office and that&#39;s creating some tension with the US and Europe. People are worried it will hurt the country&#39;s democracy and stability. 

On a sadder note, Pelé, the iconic soccer star and global ambassador for Brazil, recently passed away at 82. He helped popularize the sport in the US and brought fame to his home country. There&#39;ve been lots of tributes from around the world. 

Meanwhile in Turkey, lots of Russians and Ukrainians have settled in one of its resort towns trying to escape a war in Ukraine. 

In US news, there&#39;s an inquiry into an Alzheimer’s drug and its maker is being criticized for how much it charges for it. Southwest Airlines also had some travel chaos over the holiday weekend but they&#39;re slowly getting back normal service now. 

Finally, back in NY, there&#39;s a scandal involving some federal and local investigations into lies told by elected official George Santos during his campaign. So right now there&#39;s public dismay over that as well.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
