<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like Donald Trump is in a good position to win the upcoming GOP caucuses in Iowa. On the other hand, there&#39;s been a lot of turmoil and infighting in the Michigan Republican Party which has sparked a legal battle over removing the state&#39;s chairperson. 

In other news, Boeing has been facing a lot of scrutiny after some safety issues with their new 737 Max 9 plane recently. An Alaska Airlines flight had to make an emergency landing after part of the fuselage started ripping off while flying. 

Unions have traditionally backed Israel, but recently some have come out in protest against it. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East are high and spilled over into the University of Haifa where academics had to make space for assault rifles due to an on-going war. Two journalists were tragically killed in Gaza in an Israeli airstrike this week as well. 

Back home, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III was hospitalized without telling the White House about it and faced criticism afterward. The SAT has also been under fire lately for its supposed role in limiting college diversity, while more and more Catholics across Africa have spoken out against proclaimed blessing of same-sex couples. 

Finally, Texan marijuana buyers heading to New Mexico to enjoy relaxed cannabis laws have become such a common sight that Sunland Park along the Rio Grande almost feels like a little Amsterdam now - though how long this will last is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
