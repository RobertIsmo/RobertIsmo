<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Some startling news is happening around the world right now. In Russia, they are cracking down on domestic dissent by developing new digital technology so as to suppress opposition against a war in Ukraine. Additionally, in Ukraine, emergency responders have been offering psychosocial help to victims of air strikes and missile attacks. In Israel, hundreds of ground forces conducted an air strike that lead to the death of five Palestinians in Jenin. 

In the US, there has been debate over free speech and online bullying at the University of Chicago while there has also been an increase in American-made t-shirt sales amidst the upcoming 4th of July celebration. On the other hand, there are significantly fewer migrants crossing the southern US border than usual but it is unknown how long this period will remain. 

Meanwhile, Tunisia has become obsessed with canned tuna to add into nearly everything and inflation is pushing it beyond reach for many at prices that were once affordable. Lastly, some disaster aid experiments have suggested giving as little as $50 to people living in poverty can help protect them from disasters before they even strike!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
