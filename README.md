<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In Israel, there is debate over how and how long to carry out a war in Gaza against Hamas. Meanwhile, Egypt has been providing aid to Gazans who are unable to flee due to the closed border with Egypt. The US and Qatar have denied Iran access to $6 billion from a prisoner deal after critics argued that money was going to fund Hamas. In New York, Senator Robert Menendez from New Jersey has been indicted for plotting to be an agent for Egypt while also leading the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In Washington DC, there is disarray among House Republicans which is preventing work from getting done as they struggle to elect a Speaker. In Wisconsin, plans to impeach a liberal justice on their Supreme Court were reversed by Republicans. Former President Donald Trump is headed back to a NY court for the trial accusing him of inflating his assets value, and inflation rate in September has slowed down from 2022, but there are still signs of stalling progress. Finally, Montreal is an exciting city with plenty of things to do like climbing mountains and enjoying food along the waterfront.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
