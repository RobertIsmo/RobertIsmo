<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, politicians are fighting for the speakership of the House, and President Biden is honoring those who defended democracy on January 6. In sports, football player Damar Hamlin is making a great recovery after having his breathing tube removed and is currently talking again. In Idaho, new revelations have come to light in a murder case, while in the Ukraine there continue to be attacks despite Russia&#39;s supposed cease-fire. Western allies are sending infantry fighting vehicles to help Ukraine take on Russia and widen highways as a solution to traffic congestion. On the health front, there&#39;s a promising new treatment for early Alzheimer&#39;s that has been approved by the FDA. And finally, discussions are already underway on which films may receive Oscar nominations come 2023!</p>

<h3>Speaker Quest Reveals McCarthy’s Tenuous Grip on an Unruly Majority</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
