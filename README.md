<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Former Pope Benedict XVI has died at the age of 95 after resigning in 2013 - the first pope to do so in modern times. Recently, polls were found to have been skewed before the US election, spooking some candidates into spending more money than necessary. Additionally, the renowned newswoman Barbara Walters has passed away. Churches in Ukraine are also being used as tools of war as Ukraine tries to crack down on Russian influence. Lastly, there was an arrest in Pennsylvania related to four University of Idaho killings and more details are emerging about President Trump&#39;s tax returns.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
