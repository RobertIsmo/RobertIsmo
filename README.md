<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy few months in the news! Recently, both Donald Trump and Fox News have been met with back-to-back rebukes from the legal system over different matters. Trump is facing criminal indictment, while Fox News is going through a civil trial. Also, tornado activity has torn up the Midwest and South over the last few weeks, leaving people dead or injured. The NCAA tournament has concluded, with Iowa upsetting South Carolina for the championship. The Biden administration has managed to secure the release of two Americans who were wrongly held in Russia, but there are still obstacles in trying to free a journalist being detained there. China has been applying lessons drawn from Russia&#39;s conflict with Ukraine while in the US, the FBI has begun looking into activities of extremist group Proud Boys after the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan 6th.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
