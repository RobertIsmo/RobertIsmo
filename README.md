<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now, from international conflict to business collapses. Markets are tumbling and banking stocks are taking a beating worldwide due to fears about the global economy. Silicon Valley Bank recently collapsed, and Goldman Sachs is likely to make a big payout from the deal. There is also rising tension between Russia and America due to the downing of an American drone. In Ukraine, there are soldiers dealing with mental trauma due to the ongoing war. In U.S politics, Florida governor DeSantis has drawn criticism from Establishment Republicans after backing away from defending Ukraine from Russia. In terms of technology, recent advancements in AI have led to more accurate chatbots but have also caused problems. Scientists have just revealed a donkey family tree after extensive research on ancient origins. Meanwhile, lawyers in Texas are facing off in a closely-watched abortion pills case tomorrow. Finally, there has been some major news on the luxury yacht front - broker George Santos just helped two of his largest donors reach a private deal on a $19 million boat!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
