<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. President Biden is going after former President Trump&#39;s numerous legal proceedings, including a fraud case in which he could potentially lose control of some of his flagship real estate. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to impeach Biden, but their witnesses say not enough evidence has been presented yet. In other news, small businesses that cater to federal employees in Washington D.C. are bracing for a big economic blow if another shutdown should occur. In New York City there&#39;s a huge gap between rich and poor-- proof that the pandemic recovery has been lopsided. Lastly, leaked internal messages have exposed Huawei&#39;s attempts at lobbying to fight an American-led effort against its technology.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
