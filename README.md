<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of important things going on in the world right now. President Biden recently approved an oil project in Alaska, but also crack down on drilling and fossil fuel activities. In US news, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has had health issues recently, causing concerns for Democratic legislators. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is pushing back against calls for Senator Dianne Feinstein to resign. Also, prison officials say that human error played a role in a Pennsylvania prisoner&#39;s escape. Mayor Eric Adams of New York says the migrant crisis will destroy the city and warns it has no foreseeable end. Meanwhile Peter Navarro was convicted of contempt of Congress over January 6th subpoena and Fani Willis is accusing House Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio for trying to obstruct the racketeering case against Donald J Trump and his allies. DeSantis and Ramaswamy have stated they believe the Proud Boys&#39; sentences are too harsh. In the health sector, Covid-19 continues to affect hearts short and long-term, plus there are new vaccine formulations coming soon. Finally, first lady Jill Biden tested negative for coronavirus and this avoided upending the president&#39;s trip to India for a G20 summit.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
