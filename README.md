<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world has been facing a lot of tough issues lately. In the US, Justice Alito defended private jet travel to a luxury fishing trip even though he didn&#39;t have to disclose the trip. A submersible lost in the North Atlantic has shed more light on how it was operating, as did a $175 million boat that rescued 100 migrants from the Mediterranean sea. On the business side, the end of a student loan pause could have consequences on the economy. The Federal Reserve&#39;s chair says there&#39;s still a long way to go in fighting inflation. Addressing the opioid overdose crisis is being met with debate because of new laws regarding fentanyl. There is also an interesting story about a New York Times reporter and their role in early internet culture. Political allies are pledging billions for Ukraine&#39;s recovery, while someone who assaulted an officer during the Capitol riot got one of the stiffest sentences yet.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
