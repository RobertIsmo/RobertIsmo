<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things aren&#39;t looking great around the world right now. China&#39;s economic decline is being felt by countries across the globe, and their military is creating tension with Taiwan as they probe their defenses. There&#39;s also financial trouble in China which is setting off panic in markets and sparking outrage. In Hawaii there have been massive wildfires which have literally flattened entire neighborhoods, and with limited access to the islands the death toll has risen. In US politics, Donald Trump is facing more legal issues leading to a cash crunch, and he&#39;s been presented with a trial date for election interference. There&#39;s also an opioid settlement involving the Sacklers which has been paused pending review. On a brighter note, some digitally stolen artifacts are being returned to former colonies so they can learn about their heritage. Lastly, Russia has been occupying Ukraine for some time now and it looks like it won&#39;t end anytime soon, leaving many Russians feeling helpless.</p>

<h3>Spiraling Legal Bills Threaten Trump With a Cash Crunch</h3>

<h3>Supreme Court Pauses Opioid Settlement With Sacklers Pending Review</h3>

<h3>Her Advice to Antiwar Russians: Resistance Is Futile, So Find Ways to Cope</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
