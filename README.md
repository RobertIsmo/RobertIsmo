<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some major developments happening around the world right now. In Ukraine, soldiers pushed back Russian forces after nearly being encircled in a battle for Bakhmut. Meanwhile in Idaho, Republican activists are trying to root out the &#39;deep state&#39; by targeting a community college. In Washington, Republicans are blocking president Biden&#39;s spending bills as they increase the US debt, while across the country workers are being labeled as managers to avoid paying overtime. In South Korea, relations with Japan are thawing after icy tensions have been a problem for sometime. Here in the US, neighborhoods in cities like New York have shifted more to the right. Finally, people have started watching novelty competitions like slap fighting on TV but it&#39;s not been viewed positively.</p>

<h3>The MAGA-fication of North Idaho College</h3>

<h3>Republican Votes Helped Washington Pile Up Debt</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
