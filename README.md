<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some tense dynamics going on between the United States and China right now, with the U.S. potentially imposing investment restrictions on China which could damage diplomatic relations. On top of that, Chinese hackers have been targeting U.S. officials in the State and Commerce Departments. At NATO&#39;s summit this week, there was progress made but divisions still remain, particularly between Russia and other countries like Ukraine. Meanwhile in the U.S., House Republicans have been critical of the FBI in a contentious hearing and there is an ongoing dangerous heat wave in many parts of the South. Hollywood actors are threatening to go on strike if their contract talks collapse while inflation has cooled significantly in June, giving more hope for a soft landing. There are also interesting new developments from Milan Kundera&#39;s novels which combine elements of eroticism and subversiveness, while in Thailand, a progressive party won the election though its leader may not get voted in as prime minister due to recent setbacks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
