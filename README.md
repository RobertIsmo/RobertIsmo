<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening around the world right now! In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing a controversial proposal to overhaul the judiciary. In Ukraine, they&#39;re rebuilding a large cargo plane destroyed in a battle last year. Twitter&#39;s source code was recently leaked online and Elon Musk is valuing it at $20 billion. In sports news, the Final Four includes some surprising teams and Iowa has made it to the championship thanks to Caitlin Clark&#39;s performance. There&#39;s also been some banking news, as First Citizens are set to acquire Silicon Valley Bank, while investors are pulling back further due to recent concerns. Lastly, gun violence has been on the rise across the US, leading many to change their outlooks and life choices. Finally, Vice President Kamala Harris is visiting Africa this week in order to deepen relations and counter China&#39;s influence there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
