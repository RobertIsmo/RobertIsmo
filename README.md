<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In France, their lawmakers are furious because they won&#39;t be able to vote on raising the legal age of retirement from 62 to 64. People are protesting about this and it&#39;s causing a lot of conflict. In the United States, Florida is now conducting a massive search through math textbooks to remove any &quot;prohibited topics,&quot; like mentions of race. On the economic side of things, interest rates are lower than expected and without them Wall Street is in for a tough journey. Banks like First Republic Bank are starting to explore rescue options and regional banks all over the country are feeling the impact of this shift. In the UK, TikTok has been banned on government devices, for fear of user information being shared with China&#39;s authorities. The US Government is pushing for a sale of TikTok to resolve national security concerns, and other countries have also started trying to ban it. Finally, scientists and musicians are teaming up to document and predict climate change by recording audio of melting ice around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
