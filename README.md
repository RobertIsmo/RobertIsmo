<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news from the US right now. Drivers were stranded overnight after getting stuck in a snow jam in Kentucky and whiteout conditions and frigid temperatures have forced a travel ban in Buffalo. In Iowa, a sports reporter was sent to cover the storm even though all sporting events had been canceled. The US House of Representatives recently passed a $1.7 trillion spending package to avoid a shutdown, and a committee studying the events of January 6th has released its final report asking for accountability from those responsible. Meanwhile, the FDA has clarified that morning-after pills are not abortion pills and there is an executive who admitted her role in the FTX collapse admitting she was wrong. There are also questions about how one of the country&#39;s billionaires made his $250 million bail, and the US is giving Ukraine guided bombs as part of a $1.85 billion aid package.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
