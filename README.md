<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In India, Prime Minister Modi is not known for fielding questions from the press and his single status is understood to be motivated by keeping corruption at bay. Speaking of corruption, there&#39;s been a scandal involving US Congressman George Santos and questions about his personal finances as well as campaign fund-raising and spending. Belarus is becoming a &quot;vassal state&quot; of Russia, allowing Moscow to station nuclear weapons on its soil, and some are concerned that California&#39;s dams may fail if hit by a large storm. Closer to home, the US population has now become older than ever with a median age of 38, and North Texas has recently been hit by severe storms that have killed at least four people. Finally, several authors have come together to debate and create a list of the 25 most influential works of postwar queer literature.</p>

<h3>If Modi does field reporters’ questions, mark the day — it may be the first.</h3>
<sub>By Mujib Mashal</sub>
<p>The Indian prime minister and his staff have tightly controlled his message and media availability. Speeches to huge crowds? All good. Answering reporters’ questions live? Almost never seen.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3NHLBaG"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Why Modi and Other Indian Leaders Stay Single</h3>
<sub>By Suhasini Raj</sub>
<p>India’s politicians need a lot of time to attend to 1.4 billion people. And with corruption widespread, those without families are often seen as less likely to steal.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3p9ADBH"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Extreme Travel Rescue Operations Are Vast in Scale and Cost. Who Foots the Bill Is Murky.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
