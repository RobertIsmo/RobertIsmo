<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The U.S. is trying to isolate China, but some German companies are moving closer as they continue to expand in China so they can finance operations back home. Biden has proposed regulations to ensure two-thirds of new cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the U.S. by 2032 are all-electric. China is dominating the next big advance in batteries, which are starting to compete with lithium power cells. After a recent ruling in Texas, Democratic states are now making moves to stockpile abortion pills. A major survey of abortion providers shows legal abortions decreased by 6% in the six months following the ruling. At Cornell University, the student assembly wants faculty to alert students about potentially upsetting materials, but administrators are opposing it. The French president has come under criticism from allies for allegedly cozying up to China during his visit there. Ukraine wants to buy arms from Brazil, but Brazil is offering to broker peace instead, and a leaked document outlines Russian and Ukrainian conflict scenarios that involve the deaths of both presidents. Dog ownership surged in the pandemic and so did fresh, human-grade dog food options creating a big market opportunity. In Northern Ireland, 25 years after peace was achieved, some communities remain disillusioned due to unfulfilled opportunities they were hoping for then. Finally, President Biden is going to Belfast soon to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement and honor his own Irish roots while he&#39;s there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
