<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In the US, Representative Kevin McCarthy is facing difficulty securing votes for Speaker, and a heavily armed man at a supermarket has sparked debate about gun laws. Over in Europe, Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine have temporarily worsened global starvation and given India more power in the global system. Meanwhile, President Biden has been enacting policies which could reshape the US economy, and a suspect in New York was driven to extremism by Islamic beliefs. In China, the Covid pandemic has affected businesses and the economy is having troubles with recovery. The government jobs sector is also seeing an influx of people wanting to work there, but some are coming to regret it due to monotonous work blurring lines between personal and work life. Finally, Spain is gaining attention for its close-up card magic performers, led by Juan Tamariz, who is known as the godfather of the craft.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
