<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There is a lot of political turmoil in the US right now. A bid to remove House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his post is putting his leadership to the test, and President Trump&#39;s fraud trial recently started with lawyers for New York&#39;s Attorney General Letitia James painting him as a fraudster. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken has been showing off his guitar chops in a viral video. Russia may be planning to test a nuclear-powered missile in the Arctic and NASA is plotting how to build houses on the moon by 2040. Plus, eviction is increasingly becoming an issue, especially among Black families with young children.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
