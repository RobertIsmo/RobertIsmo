<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Iran and Saudi Arabia, two regional rivals, recently put aside their historical animosity to work together for a Gaza Cease-Fire after Israel&#39;s bombardment of the strip. There are also politics in play here in the U.S. as two young Democratic stars, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ritchie Torres, debate over the Israel-Hamas war. Donald Trump is still at it too. He just recently asked a judge to televise the upcoming Federal Election trial and released his 2025 immigration plans that involve sweeping raids, giant camps and mass deportations if he regains power. In other news, there&#39;s a story out of Russia about Konstantin Dobrovolsky trying to give decent burials to WWII dead that Russia has glorified for decades. Bishop Joseph Strickland was removed from his position as he had been critical of Pope Francis&#39; too liberal views. Additionally, Black women recently convened forty years ago to discuss how race affects their health which has inspired many changes in medical care since then. Lastly, there’s an issue with a decaying warship beached on a tiny shoal that has been provoking China&#39;s ire. Meanwhile, here in the states, Biden is still trying to manage to cancel student loan debt worth around $127 billion for millions of borrowers despite the Supreme Court blocking him from canceling it for tens of millions more borrowers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
