<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is facing backlash for his change in attitude towards the Covid-19 vaccine before a surge in hospitalizations and deaths. Israel is in turmoil because of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s hospitalization due to a heart defect as debate rages over limiting judicial power. Over in Ukraine, forces have been mired in an ongoing conflict with no end insight, while Russia has launched attacks against its port city Odesa leaving one dead. Iran is also experiencing record temperatures and water shortages while Spain will hold elections on Sunday with a chance of a far-right party entering the government for the first time since the 1970s. Meanwhile, Morocco’s women’s national soccer team has qualified for the Women’s World Cup and Chinese entrepreneurs are not confident in Beijing’s attempts to inspire confidence through their 31-point guidelines.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
