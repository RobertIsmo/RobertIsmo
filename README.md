<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is facing a lot of changes and issues. In terms of technology, chip makers are pushing back on Biden&#39;s China agenda and Nvidia, Intel and Qualcomm are campaigning to protect their business before crackdowns on the sale of semiconductor technology to Beijing. 

In the business sector, Chinese electric vehicle companies are pulling ever further ahead due to government support and rapid technological advances. Meanwhile, in the US, Trump and Republicans are bashing electric vehicles while Biden Adminstration waives regulations to expand border wall due to high numbers of migrants in the Rio Grande Valley.

Internationally, Secretary of State Blinken is visiting Mexico to discuss fentanyl, illegal migration and guns while there is a chaotic situation with border rules regarding who gets in the US. Further domestic issues include a federal inquiry for George Santos&#39;s accountant, Alabama being ordred to use congressional map that likely flips seat to Democrats and Cornel West dropping Greeb Party and running as an independent for his presidential campaign. Lastly, there is an interesting article about Tupac&#39;s murder and how it tied into warring gang factions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
