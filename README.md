<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of political news this week. The United States had its first Republican debate with eight candidates on stage, and it was an interesting one due to the fact that Donald Trump was not part of it. In other election-related news, House Republicans have begun looking into Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney in Atlanta, ahead of President Trump&#39;s upcoming booking in the area. 

In international news, there is speculation as to whether or not Russian business leader Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash. Both the Wagner Group and Russian government have yet to confirm his death. The BRICS Group has also recently expanded their reach by inviting Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia into the club of emerging nations. 

On a lighter note, there&#39;s also been some entertainment news this week. Olivia Rodrigo has taken over the pop music scene with her hit albums &quot;Sour&quot; and “Guts”; and Michael Oher is reopening a legal agreement from &quot;The Blind Side&quot; movie. Lastly, people around the world are turning to tiny forests to help reduce climate change and China is attempting to build a safety net for seniors and other financially distressed citizens amidst their housing crisis.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
