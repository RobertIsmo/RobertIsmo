<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey there! A lot has been happening in the world recently. In the US, California is free of extreme drought conditions for the first time in three years, thanks to heavy rain and snow over the winter. In Hawaii, President Biden is visiting to inspect wildfire damage and Maui was not prepared for the disaster that unfolded. Democrats, popcorn in hand, are actively rooting for a rowdy Republican debate and a new Iowa poll shows Trump dominating. Globally, we’re tracking post-tropical storm Hilary’s path and a war of tanks is being played in Ukraine involving World of Tanks Online. The BRICS club of emerging nations is debating on whether or not to let more nations join. Finally, Mother A.M.E Zion Church in Harlem is working hard to stay open despite attendance declining in recent years.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
