<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To catch my friend up on the world, it looks like things are definitely in flux right now. In the U.S., the Justice Department has just reported a pattern of discriminatory policing in Louisville and the Pentagon is blocking evidence of possible Russian war crimes heading to the Hague Court. President Biden is about to announce a major budget plan with $3 trillion in new measures and House G.O.P. plans to slash federal programs as a budget showdown looms. Internationally, Afghan women are suffering from Taliban restrictions and an end to decades of war, which is diminishing hopes for them. In terms of tech, A.I. chatbots have hit the industry and they&#39;re causing some confusion and worry. Finally, there&#39;s a congressional hearing happening looking into the lab leak theory regarding Covid-19 origins.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
