<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like some tension is building in the Middle East with Israel and Hamas being in talks to free up to 50 hostages. Meanwhile, on the US political front, there&#39;s a lot happening. We&#39;re only two debates into the Republican presidential primary and it looks like Nikki Haley has emerged as an early favorite for many. But there&#39;s also Vivek Ramaswamy who thinks celebrating diversity has come at a cost of national unity. On abortion, it looks like there is more support for abortion rights across Republicans and moderates alike than ever before. And in Ohio last week, Trump counties even voted in favor of abortion rights! There have also been some food-related news: the FDA has approved a new obesity drug called Wegovy and the long and strange criminal trail of one stolen load of expensive Japanese Kit Kats made its rounds online too. Houston just uncovered a mass grave from its dark past too - it turns out the city was originally named Sugar Land from a business reliant on forced labor by convicts. And finally, giant pandas are leaving Washington and fans are really sad about it!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
