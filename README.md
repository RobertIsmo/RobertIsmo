<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world recently that is drawing attention from world leaders and citizens alike. In the US, there has been increased tensions between the US and China, as both countries are vying for control over high-altitude areas where balloons, U.F.O.s, and missiles can be found. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Tim Scott is exploring a potential 2024 presidential run, while selling unity to a party that may be trending towards more of a Trump-esque &quot;us versus them&quot; framing. 

Further abroad, in Germany, an employee of the German spy service was apprehended on suspicion of passing intelligence to Russia. Meanwhile, Iran has been working on upgrading its Air Force fleet with advanced Russian jets.

Aside from international developments, there has been some debate in Canada about sexism and ageism in regards to Lisa LaFlamme, a longtime news anchor who was let go after she went gray. Here in the US, stock investors are becoming nervous as strong economic data shows that the economy is still running hot. In New York City specifically, progressive leaders have come out with a statement of principles which has caused some strife within the left-wing movement in the city. Additionally, a prominent lawyer in South Carolina&#39;s murder trial has evoked great interest amongst witnesses to explore what led up to his wife and son&#39;s deaths. Finally, the hit martial arts movie &#39;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&#39; has returned to theaters with its restored version amplifying the ways it was groundbreaking during its release nearly 20 years ago.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
