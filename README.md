<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, tensions in Ukraine between Ukrainian forces and Russian forces have heightened. Ukrainian officials launched a counteroffensive which has caused some divisions in the Russian armed forces. U.S. officials are hoping that could lead to some diplomatic talks, but have shot down any push for peace talks from other countries, like China. The Ukrainian President is meeting with the Pope in Italy at this potentially pivotal moment for the war against Russia. 

In the U.S., there has been record levels of border crossings, but luckily without an additional spike in migration when restrictions were lifted. To deal with these large numbers of people, the city of New York has been left with no option but to house migrant families in public school gymnasiums. Meanwhile, a man in Manhattan was arraigned on a manslaughter charge for killing another man on the subway—which was so strange because apparently it happened with no visible struggle or violence beforehand. 

On a different note, Turkey is having their presidential election on Sunday where Erdogan is seeking his second term amidst difficult odds after amassing personal power over two decades, although the election is a bit clouded by all the recent unrest happening around the world. Also, back at home, Writers’ Union struck down any waiver that could&#39;ve allowed a Tony Awards telecast come June 11th—posing a huge threat to Broadway&#39;s biggest marketing moments. 

But finally on more positive news, there&#39;s now a new drug approved by the FDA to treat hot flashes during menopause! It&#39;s the first nonhormonal treatment available to provide relief from that symptom.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
