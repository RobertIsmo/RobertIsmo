<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a lot of upheaval and unrest happening around the world right now. In the US, a police unit in Memphis has been disbanded after officers were charged with the death of a young Black man named Tyre Nichols. This has provoked a heated conversation around race and policing in America. Elsewhere, pharmaceutical companies have been exploiting US patent laws to make massive amounts of money from taxpayers. In Israel, a new far-right government has recently taken power, raising tensions and the risk of harassment for some residents. Meanwhile, Russian forces in Ukraine have been attacking strategic locations and Donald Trump is trying to gain support for his third White House bid by focussing on smaller-scale events. In other news, an FBI agent who was investigating a Russian aluminum magnate may have ended up working for him instead! Finally, tennis players at the Australian Open are now allowed to be coached from the stands and Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka won her first Grand Slam title over the weekend - a huge moment amidst the backdrop of war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
