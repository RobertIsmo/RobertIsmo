<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of activity happening in the world right now. In the US, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas recently gained access to an elite circle that opened doors to the court, while President Biden has stated that Ukraine is not yet ready for NATO membership. NATO is trying to get a better understanding of its relationship with the alliance, while Ukraine celebrated the return of Azov commanders who were held as prisoners of war. Meanwhile, the US and China are talking despite their deep differences, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visiting Beijing to discuss their differences. In New York, a man who was wrongfully convicted of rape has gone from being behind bars to running for city hall. The number of migrants at the border has also decreased because Mexico has been helping the US stem the flow. Finally, experts are pointing out how sleep needs vary depending on age and stage in life. In Mississippi Delta, residents have been left with the difficult decision whether to rebuild after a tornado or move on due to years of disinvestment and decline.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
