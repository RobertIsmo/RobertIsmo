<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now.  In the U.S., President Trump has shaken up his legal team ahead of an Atlanta booking, Republicans candidates discussed abortion more than any other issue during the first debate, and Nikki Haley is looking to turn her debate moment into momentum. Over in Russia, a reminder was issued of the high cost for standing up to President Putin. Across the pond, pop&#39;s brightest new hope Olivia Rodrigo just dropped her second album, while in Maui officials are suing Hawaiian Electric for allowing a deadly fire to start. New York Governor Kathy Hochul is pushing Biden to speed up migrant permits, and there&#39;s a lawsuit that centers around the movie &#39;The Blind Side&#39;. Finally, tiny forests with big benefits are delivering environmental benefits across the globe and here in the U.S.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
