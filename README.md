<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been recent tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Gaza resulting in communication blackouts and a fear of violence, fueled by arms shipments. Meanwhile, in the US, Donald Trump is doing better than expected in polls before the election, due to young, nonwhite and less engaged voters not showing as much support for incumbent President Biden. Biden&#39;s team is emphasizing that election polling is unreliable this far out. Banks are giving unclear reasons for closing customer accounts without warning. In states like Maine, the Deaf community has yet again faced violence against them. And finally, two people from Ethiopia set a course record in New York City&#39;s Marathon!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
