<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on in the world recently. In the US, there have been debates about defunding police and reforming law enforcement practices, as well as criminal proceedings against the former president. Elsewhere around the world, there has been a tragic migrant shipwreck in Greece that left hundreds dead, and a similar incident in Ukraine that raised safety concerns about a nuclear plant. Closer to home, we&#39;ve seen Ja Morant suspended for 25 games after appearing in a series of social media videos wielding guns. It certainly looks like it won&#39;t be quiet anytime soon!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
