<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now.  The U.S. and China are engaged in a spy war, trying to collect intelligence on each other&#39;s leadership thinking and military capabilities. In the U.S., President Biden&#39;s re-election bid has been supported by Democratic party leaders, but it seems less popular with voters based on opinion polls. Meanwhile, there has been an increase in female athletes and some major shifts in power inside the Texas Republican party. Ken Paxton was recently acquitted in a Senate trial of charges related to corruption and abuse of office. There was also a case from Yale involving rape allegations that challenged campus disciplinary hearings. Closer to home, Wall Street investors have bought up a lot of starter homes and converted them into rentals, putting first-time buyers at a disadvantage and raising questions for our communities. On the international front, Finland&#39;s President has warned Europe about becoming complacent with Russia while some cargo ships were sent to Ukraine after Russia ended its grain deal with it. There is also news about Jann Wenner, co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine - he was removed from the Rock Hall Board due to some comments he made during an interview - and then defended his legacy in a separate interview. Finally, Sandra Bullock&#39;s movies have shown us how technology is impacting humanity&#39;s relationship with modernity.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
