<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, migrant children are being put to work and the government has been ignoring warnings. There was an 84-year-old man in Kansas City who was charged with shooting a black teenager. In Akron, Ohio, a grand jury declined to charge officers involved in a shooting death of a black man. Speaker of the House McCarthy proposed a one-year debt ceiling increase tied to spending cuts as an alternative to President Biden&#39;s proposal. Additionally, House Republicans held a field hearing and targeted district attorney in New York, claiming his policies had caused a crime spree. Additionally, Latavia McGee was one of many Americans who were kidnapped and two were killed after seeking cosmetic surgery in Mexico. Furthermore, 19 children lost their lives due to gun violence in Uvalde, Texas recently. Around the world, hospitals and aid groups have become targets in Sudan as two generals vying for power agreed to stand down and there is much violence among civilians. Additionally, there is a paramilitary group known as Rapid Support Forces fighting against the Sudanese Army. In running news, Boston Marathon bombing survivors celebrated 10 years after the attack with no overwhelming presence of bombings at the marathon this year while in Texas to New Jersey hazardous chemicals were transported which shed light on risks associated with plastics production growth. Lastly, two men have been charged by the FBI and accused of conspiring with the Chinese government and destroying evidence at police outpost located here in New York. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
