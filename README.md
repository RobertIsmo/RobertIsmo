<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting developments happening all over the world that I wanted to share with you! In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing a tight race for re-election as he stands for his two-decades-long reign. In the US, Republicans and Democrats are locked in a bitter battle over abortion rights and North Carolina may be the deciding factor. Russia is facing allegations of receiving U.S.-made technology despite sanctions, but their own weather conditions are creating problems due to climate change. Paraguay has an unusually enduring political party that buys votes from Indigenous people on Election Day. And finally, there are many companies now switching their language regarding diversity and inclusion to focus on “diversity and belonging” instead.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
