<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In New York, the FBI has seized Mayor Eric Adams&#39; phones and iPad as part of an investigation into his campaign finances. Meanwhile, a 25-year-old fund-raising chief of Adams&#39; campaign is also under scrutiny after a federal raid. In Washington, Democrats are struggling to keep their majority in the Senate since West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is not running for re-election. There are also some House Republicans who are pushing back on abortion curbs due to alarm over losses from last year. Betting on the presidential election has started in some places despite court challenges. In Gaza, there is a large underground network of tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and goods. Israel is now considering a deal with Hamas to free all civilian hostages in Gaza. Germany has been banning pro-Palestinian demonstrations and protests in the name of fighting anti-Semitism, which has raised some concerns about free speech restrictions. Across the US, cities like San Francisco are taking big steps to prepare for world leaders who will soon be visiting for international conferences. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is dynamically negotiating with China regarding economic ties that should promote a healthy relationship between the two countries. And finally, an airplane pilot who was charged with attempted murder told his side of why he tried to crash his plane while high on mushrooms — he wanted to avoid treatments that could threaten his career. Finally, a pastor indicted along with former President Donald Trump for pressuring an elections worker in Georgia asked evangelical supporters for help.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
