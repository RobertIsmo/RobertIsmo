<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is very turbulent right now. In Israel, there are huge protests and clashes with the police in Jerusalem. Ukraine is working to rebuild a colossal plane destroyed in a battle for its airfield last year. And, former National Enquirer publisher has been testifying in the case against former president Trump. On the sports side, we have an unexpected Final Four in women&#39;s basketball and L.S.U got past its cold shooting to advance too. There are also issues of natural disasters in California&#39;s Central Valley where emergency crews are racing to save farms. Meanwhile, research on chatbots has unveiled interesting insights on theories of mind and machine learning. In other news, there is a discussion on how penmanship has become obsolete and advice on building college rankings.</p>

<h3>The Final Four That Nobody Could Have Expected</h3>
<sub>By Billy Witz</sub>
<p>Connecticut has a pedigree but hasn’t made a deep run since 2014. Florida Atlantic plays in a small gym on a campus that’s an owl sanctuary. San Diego State got in on a free throw. And Miami’s coach likes his self-help advice.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3LXwmKm"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>The Scramble to Save California’s Heartland</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
