<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot happening in the world. In the US, President Biden is facing political fallout from a case involving his son Hunter Biden. Democrats and some undecided swing voters have suggested that this won&#39;t be a deciding factor in the upcoming election. In other news, devastating wildfires in Lahaina have destroyed about 1,900 structures. 

In Ukraine, the country that is locked in political turmoil with Russia, their government has had to relax their anticorruption rules to get newer weapons. They have also taken measures to cut off Russian supply lines to the Crimean peninsula. 

On the entertainment side of things, it&#39;s been a bit of a break from new shows due to long-standing strikes. But it did give people the chance to watch some old shows they may have missed out on before. 

Finally, in sports news, England&#39;s lionesses soccer team have made it all the way to the Women&#39;s World Cup Semifinals and are looking to take on host Australia Wednesday!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
