<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting and important news stories happening in the world right now. In the US, officials are discussing ways to diplomacy with Russia while confronting backlogged immigration courts due to a lack of judges. Immigration politics will remain a prominent issue in the 2024 race, as it did when Donald Trump ran for president. Also in the US, there is an upcoming risk of running out of cash in June, and Elon Musk has appointed Twitter&#39;s new chief.

Meanwhile, on a global scale, people are focusing on Turkey’s presidential election, which could determine Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s control of the country. There has also been an investigation into how a major earthquake in Turkey led to fatalities due to flawed design and limited oversight. And lastly, in a more lighter note, some mothers are creating “mommunes” where they live under one roof and split the household bills among themselves while raising their children.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
