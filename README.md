<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like there is a lot of legal drama going on at the moment. Fox News recently settled a defamation case with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, and there are several other legal cases they&#39;re entangled in. In politics, Ron DeSantis, Florida&#39;s governor, is trying to rally support from his own party without much luck. Also in Florida, an 84-year-old homeowner has been charged with two felonies after fatally shooting a teen who rang their doorbell by accident. Upstate, details have emerged about a deadly shooting that took place in the wrong driveway. Finally, on the tech side of things, Netflix has announced that it will be ending its DVD service, while the FDA has authorized an additional Covid booster shot for people over 65.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
