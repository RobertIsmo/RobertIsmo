<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of controversy in Israel right now as the government attempts to reduce the power of the Supreme Court, leading to protests and threats to shut down large parts of the economy. Meanwhile, the Biden administration in the US is having a tense but turbulent relationship with Israel, while studies of elite college admissions data are uncovering evidence that being very wealthy is its own qualification. In Arizona, there&#39;s a plan to give every student $7,200 for school choice that could ultimately benefit wealthier families.

Elsewhere, there were reports of drones attacks targeting Moscow that were destroyed by Russia, which blamed Ukraine for the incident. There&#39;s also an interesting story in New York about a dog walker who thought they had a rolled-up painting worth millions - only for Sotheby’s to plan an auction - before it all fell apart. The IRS has halted surprise visits to homes and businesses amid backlash and increased threats.

On the science front, an astrophysicist from Harvard has taken a deep dive for alien life and believes material he&#39;s recovered from the ocean floor could be from an extraterrestrial spacecraft, although his peers are skeptical. Lastly, Republican presidential candidates are supposed to face off in Milwaukee on Aug 23rd but Donald Trump may not show up due to some complicated rules, and only some have made the cut so far. Finally, if you&#39;re looking for a workout plan this year to stay fit and healthy, there are some excellent ones out there already!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
