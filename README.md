<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, troops are using Nazi symbols on their front lines, which is causing concern about Russian propaganda and its potential to spread imagery. In the US, an Oklahoma court has approved the first religious charter school funded by taxpayers, likely signaling the start of a legal battle. The SEC has accused Binance, the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, of mishandling funds and lying to regulators. Three politicians—Mike Pence, Chris Christie, and Doug Burgum—have all declared themselves candidates for the 2024 presidential election. Donald Trump&#39;s lawyers recently visited the Justice Department to discuss their concerns as an inquiry nears its end. A young man called &#39;the Compassion Guy&#39; who devoted his life to helping others was tragically killed in Louisiana last week. Chris Licht, CEO of CNN is facing issues related to building trust with his network. Finally, Robert Hanssen, an FBI Agent exposed as a spy for Moscow, died at 79 this week. There is also ongoing speculation about whether or not we are out of a bear market in stocks and shares; and rescue workers have found three people missing from an Iowa building collapse dead this morning. Scientists also recently put forward a strange theory that our human ancestors buried their dead in caves and may have lit fires and decorated walls around their graves.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
