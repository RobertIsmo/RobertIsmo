<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some important things happening all around the world. In Turkey, voters will decide whether or not to keep President Erdogan in power in Sunday’s election. Meanwhile, in the United States, immigration remains a hot-button issue, especially as certain pandemic-era restrictions are beginning to lift. In New York City, the mayor has come under criticism for attempting to house migrant families in public school gymnasiums. In Germany, meanwhile, leaders have just announced their biggest ever military aid package for Ukraine, which involves sending nearly $3 billion in aid to help the nation in its ongoing war against Russia. Lastly, there is a homeless crisis unfolding on the streets of San Diego and a scandal involving fraudulent campaign finances swirling around a member of Congress from New York.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
