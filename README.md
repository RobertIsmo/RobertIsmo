<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like world leaders are discussing diplomatic important issues. CIA Director William J. Burns held talks in Warsaw with the head of the Israeli spy agency Mossad and the Prime Minister of Qatar to discuss hostage and prisoner exchanges between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli military also took reporters on a tour of a Hamas tunnel that&#39;s wide enough to handle cars. There&#39;s tension in the Red Sea, with BP pausing oil shipments due to fears of attacks by drones or missiles. In good news, Pope Francis just allowed priests to bless same-sex relationships though it still doesn&#39;t change traditional doctrine. Closer to home, the United Methodist Church is splitting up due to differing views on LGBTQ policies and quarter of churches in the denomination have left. 

In the arts world, there&#39;s a fascinating story about a magazine made by a German Jew who was hiding from the Nazis in an attic being rediscovered after all these years. There&#39;s also been some controversy related to comedian Hasan Minhaj after he rebutted a New Yorker article with a video - that went over surprisingly well with the audience. 

On the business front, Trevor Milton, founder of the electric vehicle company Nikola, will be sentenced for fraud and this case has exposed some of the bad practices going on in this industry. Meanwhile, there&#39;s drama at South Korea conglomerate LG where a dispute between a former chairman&#39;s widow and his adopted son is testing family succession in this 10 billion dollar multinational company. 

Finally, there have been many notable deaths this year including Sandra Day O&#39;Connor, Henry Kissinger, Rosalynn Carter, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett and more - so if you want to suggest someone for a New York Times obituary then you can do that too!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
