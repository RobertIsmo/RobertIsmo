<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now! In Hawaii, a historic town was destroyed as high winds caused a wildfire to overrun the area. Meanwhile, in Ukraine soldiers are struggling with mental health issues due to their experiences in the counteroffensive. But it&#39;s not all bad news: Japan is recovering slowly from the pandemic and China recently suspended its report on youth unemployment, which had been at record highs earlier this year. On the sports side, Michael Oher, who was featured in the movie &quot;The Blind Side,&quot; says he was conned into signing away his decision-making powers when he was 18. And finally, renewable energy is becoming more common in both areas that support oil and gas and those that seek to move away from them, as people recognize that addressing global warming is essential for our future.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
