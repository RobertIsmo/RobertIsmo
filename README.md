<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening around the world right now. A powerful earthquake just struck Turkey, creating a lot of seismological activity. Meanwhile, the US and China are engaging in some kind of spy game, which appears to involve balloons. In Ukraine, the country is facing corruption scandals as well as a war, and some people are taking a respite from it by visiting ski resorts in the Carpathian Mountains. 

The 65th annual Grammy Awards happened recently, with hip-hop taking center stage in a joyous performance. Joe Biden gave his State of Union address recently to call for cooperation between both parties, although this may not be likely. The Koch Network is getting involved in G.O.P. primary elections in order combat former President Trump&#39;s policies, and North Carolina&#39;s Supreme Court is re-examining Democratic rulings with their new Republican majority. 

In sports news, the Brooklyn Nets traded Kyrie Irving to the Dallas Mavericks after his refusal to get vaccinated and other incidents. And finally, there&#39;s a guide that can help people save money while also fighting climate change by taking advantage of savings from the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
