<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To sum up what&#39;s going on in the world, US politics are a bit chaotic. The Biden documents case has raised a lot of questions, particularly surrounding Robert Hur&#39;s new role as special counsel for the investigation. Meanwhile, tanks from the West have been sent to Ukraine as a way of showing their support against a new Russian offensive. On the crime front, Idaho has seen one of its researchers charged with four murders after displaying little emotion or remorse. Moving on to business news, the Trump Organization has been handed an $1.6 million fine for evading taxes and providing executive off-the-books benefits. Away from politics and crime, Bill Nighy is courting Oscar success with the release of &#39;Living.&#39; Another controversial figure is rapper Young Thug, who&#39;s been accused of leading a violent gang operating through his music label YSL. Lastly, California&#39;s been flooded lately and Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley, sadly passed away at 54 years old. Celebrities paid tribute to her on social media and remembered her career as a musician and actress.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software.
