<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve recently been catching up with the news and there&#39;s a lot of activity happening around the world right now. In Gaza, hostages have been released but they have returned to Israel malnourished and psychologically affected by their experience. Tourism in the Middle East has been suffering due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. On a sadder note, Henry Kissinger, one of most powerful secretaries of state of the postwar era, passed away at 100. 

On a lighter note, America has been focused on two events: the DeSantis-Newsom debate between a Republican presidential candidate and a high-profile Democratic governor, and the albums that made an impact this year in music. 

Finally, India is under scrutiny due to an assassination on U.S. soil allegedly ordered by a government official, and then there&#39;s also the U.K.&#39;s royal racism furor after a &quot;mistake&quot; in book publishing reignited some old tensions there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
