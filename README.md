<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! A House panel has recently revealed that despite an IRS mandate, President Trump was not audited while in office. Reports have also shown that he paid $1.1 million in taxes during his presidency but nothing in 2020. In other news, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to visit Washington DC and address Congress. The US has also promised Ukraine Patriot missiles for the first time. Seniors are now struggling to get Covid-19 booster shots, and former Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris has died just days before the 50th anniversary of one of the NFL’s most memorable plays. There&#39;s a storm headed towards the Midwest bringing subzero temperatures and blizzard conditions with it over the holidays, making things harder for workers on the front lines. Elon Musk recently announced that he&#39;ll resign as CEO of Twitter when he finds his successor and while doing so, he&#39;s attached some strings. Lastly, Christmas in Gyor, Hungary is looking different this year as dimmed festive lighting at an annual market reflects economic hardship across Hungary due to energy costs and inflation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
