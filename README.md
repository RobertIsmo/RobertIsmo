<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of unrest in the Middle East. The United States has advised Israel to delay a Gaza invasion while more time is needed to negotiate and deliver aid to Palestinians. Hamas failed to make the case that Israel struck a hospital in Gaza which killed hundreds, while Israel said the explosion was caused by a Palestinian rocket instead. There was another incident near Lebanon border where an Israeli reservist from Maryland, Omer Balva, was killed when his unit was hit with anti-tank missile fire. 

Additionally, President Donald Trump is under scrutiny due to questions of potential access and national security with Australia&#39;s wealthiest man Anthony Pratt. Republicans are also running for speaker of the House, and there have been commando raids against Russian forces near Crimea. 

On an environmental note, there are efforts being made to support migrants in Britain which has been driving positive outcomes for the population living outside of the immigration system. Unfortunately, this project has come to an end due to political reasons. Lastly, climate change is having an effect on psychotherapy as it&#39;s keeping therapists up at night concerning the future of our planet.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
