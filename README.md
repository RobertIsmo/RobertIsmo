<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a lot going on in the world. In Ukraine, volunteers with historical grievances against Russia are taking up arms and fighting against Moscow. Meanwhile, some of the former Soviet republics are using tape, scales, and 3-D printers to turn fragmentation grenades into tank-killers. In the US, there was an overnight session in Congress to decide the new Speaker. This has been part of a zero-sum politics that has mutated over time into what it is now. In Asia, populations are aging quickly, with elderly workers staying in the workforce well beyond their seventies. In an art history class, Muslim students have voiced an outcry over a painting of the Prophet Muhammad. This painting is considered a masterpiece by many scholars. There is also ongoing debate in New York City over dirt roads - both for maintenance and cultural implications. Migrants from the border are settling in New York and facing both help and hardship as they integrate into society. And finally, the NFL has returned this weekend after Damar Hamlin&#39;s collapse last Monday - with many questions still unanswered about what happened and how to cover it appropriately moving forward.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
