<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of weather-related events taking place around the world. The Southwest in the US is dealing with an intense heatwave and record temperatures over 110 degrees, while New York is contending with heavy rains that have caused flash flooding and the Hudson Valley has received up to eight inches of rain. Also, a huge tornado recently swept through Mississippi and people are deciding whether to rebuild or move on in its aftermath. 

Internationally, President Biden has said that Ukraine is not yet ready for NATO membership and he will be attending a summit in Europe this week to discuss this and other matters. In addition, the President is meeting with King Charles III in Britain and the two share similar interests and challenges that might help them get along. 

In other news, sleep patterns change throughout one&#39;s lifespan and experts have provided tips to get better rest regardless of age. Plus, a man exonerated after a wrongful rape conviction has gone on to win an election to city hall in New York, which speaks to a shift in attitudes toward crime. Finally, Mexico is helping the US to control the number of migrants at their border but some worry this won&#39;t last long since more migrants are flowing into southern Mexico. Last but not least, visitors to the Pantheon in Italy must now pay 5 euros for entry, which has caused confusion for some people and further concerns about abuse of the system.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
