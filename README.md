<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In the United States, a judge recently rejected an effort by former President Donald Trump to interfere in an election case in Georgia. Meanwhile, Trump&#39;s political action committee is nearly broke after covering legal bills for himself and his associates. On the international front, Ukraine has been carrying out drone and missile attacks on Russia to hamper Moscow&#39;s military logistics and send a message of protest. Ukraine has also been sending drones into Russian soil to launch long-range strikes. Regarding health, Oregon has taken steps to curb opioid overdoses by decriminalizing small amounts of illicit drugs. In the arts world, Paul Reubens, creator of Pee-Wee Herman, recently passed away at age 70. And finally, on the women&#39;s sports front, we&#39;re learning about how teams can advance to the round of 16 in next year&#39;s Women&#39;s World Cup.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
