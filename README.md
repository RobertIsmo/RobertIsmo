<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, a lot is happening in the world. In the US, Donald J. Trump was recently indicted for illegally keeping classified government documents after leaving office. In Ukraine, there is a Russian invasion that has prompted multiple attacks from Ukraine. In Canada, there have been devastating wildfires and toxic smoke due to climate change that could become the new normal. Boris Johnson resigned as Prime Minister of the UK this week. Two founders of a cryptocurrency hedge fund have been traveling around the world since the implosion of their company. George Santos, a politician in New York, has been bailed out by his family members whose identities he asked to keep secret. An investor linked to an impeachment case against the attorney general in Texas has been charged with lying to lenders and jailed by the FBI. It was recently revealed NASA&#39;s Apollo 11 moon quarantine had some holes in it and Apple is rolling out changes to autocorrect on iPhones so they can better detect word contexts in text messages. Finally, an opinion article explores what it will take to convict Trump of breaching any laws he may have committed while in office.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
