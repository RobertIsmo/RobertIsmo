<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. In the US, former President Donald J. Trump has been indicted, which breaks a two-century-old taboo against indicting presidents. In Russia, American reporter have been arrested and accused of spying, which is not something we’ve seen since the Cold War. Finland is on their way to joining NATO, which is a significant defeat for Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. There is also some unrest in France due to government actions that have angered some people in Bordeaux and elsewhere. Here in the US, Nashville is still grieving from a recent school shooting and trying to cope with its political divisions. On the environmental front, California is planning to require half of all heavy trucks sold by 2035 to be electric in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, Big Tech and Wall Street are both in the news for various reasons: Big Techs massive profits are leading some central bankers to worry about persistent inflation, while Wall Street’s crisis in March was camouflaged thanks to the rally of technology stocks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
