<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of conflict happening around the world. In Ukraine, a Russian soldier has been fighting in the war and experiencing the drudgery of trench work. Meanwhile, the chief rabbi of Ukraine has become well-known for his humanitarian efforts since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion. In Israel, there was a deadly raid on the West Bank City that left at least 12 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier dead. Also, Palestinian attacks on Tel Aviv left at least eight wounded. There has also been violence in the West Bank with many teenagers writing out their last words. 

In other news, paralyzed by a police bullet, Khalif Cooper describes his life as forever changed. Meanwhile, Andrew Ridgeley talks about George Michael and life after the band Wham! plus there is a review of the duo&#39;s success and turbulent end. In China, a woman was left to uncover her husband&#39;s secret cause as he was a brilliant anonymous dissident blogger. Closer to home in Philadelphia and Louisiana there were mass shootings, leaving five dead and seven wounded. To top it off, the Democratic National Committee has had a primary problem with South Carolina voting first in 2024 not going according to plan.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
