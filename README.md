<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of news happening in the US and around the world. In the US, George Mason University’s law school is facing scrutiny as it has cultivated close ties to justices, offering generous pay and unusual perks. In Russia, hundreds of men face criminal charges for becoming war refuseniks in response to Moscow&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. President Biden recently took a jab at Fox News while delivering remarks at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. In San Francisco, tech workers staying home due to the pandemic has forced civic leaders to confront tough challenges related to the city’s recovery. In London, citizens are responding with a “take it or leave it” shrug to King Charles’s coronation. Meanwhile, states are pushing for new age restrictions for young people online that could also impact adults’ access to services. And in New York, there&#39;s an uptick in interest for Bryant Park’s secret penthouse. Lastly, there is news out of First Republic where regulators are preparing to seize and sell it after troubled times; and in Brooklyn, victims from last year’s subway shooting are still feeling the effects of the incident.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
