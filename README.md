<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world! Millions of Americans may soon lose their Medicaid coverage, as pandemic protections come to an end and states begin redetermining their eligibility for the program. Donald Trump is headed back to New York City for his court arraignment this week, and law enforcement is prepping for potential chaos. Meanwhile, there&#39;s plenty of tension in Ukraine, with newly formed military units being used in preparation for a massive spring counteroffensive. On brighter news, California&#39;s record snowpack has been measured with precision by low-flying planes, helping forecasters make predictions on how it&#39;ll melt. Lastly, the WNBA is facing an immense talent conundrum, as lots of great college talent can only squeeze into 144 spots on the WNBA roster.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
