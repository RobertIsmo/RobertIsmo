<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is experiencing many developments right now. In Israel, the military has uncovered information about Hamas to better understand their tactics and abilities. In the U.S., there was a heated Republican presidential debate with no direct attacks on former president Donald Trump. Additionally, college presidents are facing criticism for not responding decisively to questions about antisemitism. In tech, start-ups are running out of time and money due to the pandemic, while in the art world, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has unveiled a new rooftop installation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
