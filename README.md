<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are quite a few different headlines. In the United States, former President Donald Trump is heading to Florida for a court appearance in a case involving documents. Floridians have mixed feelings about the proceedings. And, there is a recent indictment against Trump showing evidence from one of his own lawyers. 

Elsewhere, Russia is facing fear and mayhem as its war with Ukraine has come home; killing at least 12 people and displacing thousands. Italy is mourning the death of their former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi who passed away at the age of 86. His influence on Italian politics and culture left an imprint whether it was for better or worse. 

On YouTube, internet sensation MrBeast has become known for his acts of altruism but many people question whether or not he&#39;s evil. And lastly, noise pollution can take years off your life so we&#39;re being reminded to reduce our risk by checking how exposed we are to noise. On the same topic, there&#39;s also a story about Love Canal which is America&#39;s first Superfund site and some nearby residents were never informed by authorities that their homes were close to the contaminated area.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
