<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! The Pentagon is having trouble keeping up with arms production for the US, and Ukraine has had to become skilled at treating amputees due to war. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine may lose access to Indonesia&#39;s visa-on-arrival program because tourists from those countries have been behaving badly. In Montana, there&#39;s a landmark climate case lawsuit where sixteen young Montanans are arguing that the state&#39;s support of fossil fuels violates the state Constitution. Donald Trump is facing an investigation related to blocking efforts to reclaim classified material and potentially misleading his lawyer, and he recently made a speech in Waco, Texas related to the 30th anniversary of a federal raid at the city. To make matters worse, he also posted overnight warning of potential violence if he is indicted. India also has political turmoil as the opposition leader was just expelled from parliament. The US just launched airstrikes after a drone attack in Syria killed an American contractor, and Tennessee just rejected $8.8 million in federal funding which alarms HIV prevention groups because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll be cut off if they don&#39;t align with his conservative politics. On a slightly lighter note, New Jersey has had a strong presence in men&#39;s basketball during the NCAA Tournament with Princeton and Fairleigh Dickinson pulling upsets and a guard from Iowa going viral for her long range shots!</p>

<h3>A Trump Rally, a Right-Wing Cause and the Enduring Legacy of Waco</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
