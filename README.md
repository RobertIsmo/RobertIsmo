<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of events happening around the world right now. In Poland, foreign refugees from Ukraine are being accepted more and increasing their influence over NATO and the Ukraine policy. In Israel, a deadly gunfight has broken out between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen during an operation to arrest Palestinian fighters. Taiwan is experiencing tension over a proposed U.S. expansion for its semiconductor company. In Plains, Georgia, the hometown of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is anticipating his death as he enters hospice care, and experts are explaining what that care entails. The Midwest has been hit with heavy snowfall and Los Angeles County is preparing for a rare blizzard, while Ohio is still suffering from a train derailment with toxic chemicals, which has put the lifestyle of many farm owners in jeopardy. Meanwhile, President Trump has gone to East Palestine in an attempt to draw a contrast with President Biden&#39;s administration and their handling of the train derailment disaster.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
