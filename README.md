<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot of international tension right now. The US Navy has released a report detailing serious problems at a brutal SEAL training course, including overzealous instructors, unchecked drug use, and inadequate leadership and medical oversight. Meanwhile in Russia, their old bombs have continued to elude Ukraine&#39;s modern defenses.

Closer to home, Republicans and Democrats are negotiating on debt limit talks while the Supreme Court has ruled that states are not eligible for windfalls in tax disputes. In politics, Florida&#39;s Governor Ron DeSantis is making a flurry of friendly interviews and going on tour, while the fashioning of his wife Casey DeSantis has been drawing comparisons to famous political couples.

Finally, there is tragedy in New York when a woman was shoved into a train due to the precarious and terrifying state of the city post pandemic. Other stories paint a picture of things going wrong; a luxury wine store is accused of owing $2.8 million in unpaid sales taxes.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
