<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of unrest around the world. In Syria, millions have suffered from a catastrophic earthquake, with thousands dead and many left homeless. Aid has been slow to reach survivors of the disaster, and there is a subterranean hospital in the region filled with tragedy: both alive victims and those who have died. China is also causing unease by sending spy balloons over military sites worldwide.

In the US, several topics are making headlines. At one hearing, former Twitter executives were questioned about whether the social media platform has been censoring the right. The run-in between Republican Senator Mitt Romney and newly elected Congressman Carlos Santos reflected the tension inside the party. Meanwhile, President Biden is attempting to win back support from white working-class voters through their wallets by offering economic relief in his State of Union address, but viewership has declined for it instead. 

Elsewhere, Ukraine&#39;s president Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to Britain to ask for fighter planes he said would represent &quot;wings of freedom.&quot; A lot is also happening in the tech world. With Microsoft&#39;s addition of A.I. technology into its search engine, Bing may finally offer some competition to Google. Unfortunately for tweeters though, Twitter recently went down with many users unable to post or message one another on Wednesday.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
