<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been hearing some really wild news lately. In Russia, they withdrew from a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain across the Black Sea despite a wartime blockade, and warned ships sailing around Ukrainian ports would be seen as military targets. On top of that, families of children with cancer in Ukraine are struggling even more due to the war with Russia.

Over in the US, Donald Trump’s legal woes are mounting as key criminal and civil trials could overlap with next year&#39;s presidential primaries. It&#39;s also been hot all over Europe lately – so much so that countries that weren&#39;t used to napping in the middle of the day are now looking into it. There&#39;s also been reports about genetic mutations causing the elderly to go into dementia in middle age and writers in Hollywood fighting for better roles.

Closer to home, people have been gathering around hookah lounges and a new bill has just passed the House to improve air travel. Lastly, some intriguing insight came from documents written by Caroline Ellison – a key witness in an FTX crypto exchange case. Pretty wild, right?</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
