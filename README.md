<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. In the US, a jury recently awarded $5 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll over her claims of an assault, and the government has pledged $1.2 billion so Ukraine can buy air defense missiles and other equipment. On the health front, it has been advised that women start getting regular mammograms at age 40, and Wall Street is preparing for a debt ceiling showdown. There is also tech cold war between China and the US, affecting wireless carriers throughout multiple states. On the lighter side of things, at this year&#39;s Westminster Dog Show in New York City, a Samoyed was awarded runner up in consecutive years, and the Met Museum has set a plan in place to find any looted art within its collection. Lastly, we have a story of how dementia affects mothers and loved ones.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
