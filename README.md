<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few stories of international conflict happening right now. In Ukraine, a teacher was recruited by Russian forces to fight with a rifle if they break into the capital, Kyiv. In response, a top Chinese official snapped at the US for its &#39;hysterical&#39; balloon response to the war in Ukraine. 

The US is also dealing with some drama of its own. They have called off their search for unidentified objects that they shot down. Meanwhile, there have been tremors in Turkey which left survivors searching desperately for shelter, while one professional soccer player was found dead after the quake. 

In Washington, the Coast Guard is running one of the toughest water-rescue training programs in the world on one of the most treacherous corners of the river Columbia. And Senator Fetterman from Pennsylvania has disclosed his depression, signaling a growing openness about mental health issues. 

Some are questioning how green electric pickup trucks really are and government agencies have been taking action to crack down on crypto practices. Finally, Nigeria has elections coming up soon with an unexpected third-party candidate who has a lot of young voters energized behind him.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
