<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! Actors and writers in Hollywood are striking right now, which is impacting the production of movies and TV shows. In a historic move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration just approved the first over-the-counter birth control pill that will be available in a couple years. The U.S. House of Representatives just voted on limiting access to abortions for military personnel, and President Biden recently voiced support for a prisoner swap to free an American held abroad. On top of that, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating some of the potential harms of certain technologies, and the chair was recently criticized at a congressional hearing. There&#39;s even some drama with pickleball in Central Park!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
