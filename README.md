<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some major developments around the world recently that we should know about. In Hawaii, wildfires have been contained but there could still be an increase in the death toll as search efforts continue. In the US, there is a Supreme Court review of an opioid settlement involving the wealthy Sackler family, and the US has reached a deal with Iran to free American detainees in exchange for access to $6 billion for humanitarian relief and the release of jailed Iranians. Iran and the US also appear to be observing an informal agreement controlling Iran&#39;s nuclear program. There is a proposed January date for former President Trump&#39;s election interference trial, and two legal professors have argued that the 14th Amendment makes Trump ineligible to hold government office. In New York, there is a bizarre defamation fight between a wealthy teenager and a 5-star hotel. Ecuador has been forever changed after a presidential candidate&#39;s assassination from drug gangs. Russia has been attacking Ukraine with drones, and Biden has requested $24 billion in aid for Ukraine against Russian forces. The Russian economy has been under pressure due to war and sanctions, and Sweden has empowered a government agency to combat Kremlin disinformation online.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
