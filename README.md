<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been pretty crazy politically and economically lately. Just last week, House Democrats released Donald Trump&#39;s tax returns following questions about why the IRS didn&#39;t fully audit him while he was president. Turns out he paid $1.1 million in the first three years of his presidency and nothing the fourth year, as his income dwindled. At the same time, there has been a lot of speculation about whether the long stock market rally will continue this year; inflation and high interest rates could derail it. Home prices, rents, inventory and interest rates have been mostly stagnant in the housing market lately, though there have been some modest signs of revival. Mergers &amp; acquisitions activity also dropped significantly in the second half of 2022 but could rise again soon. On top of all that, we saw Representative-elect George Santos face criticism for fabricating his résumé and spending $40,000 on air travel with campaign funds. 

Internationally, we&#39;ve seen Chinese President Xi Jinping meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ties between their countries, which is especially important considering Russia&#39;s recent invasion of Ukraine. It also marks 100 years since the birth of the Soviet Union. Climate change is still a very pressing issue with thousands of wind farms proposed in the US, but they face a lot of local resistance. Finally, there was some really positive news with Pelé&#39;s 90th birthday - he was acclaimed as soccer&#39;s greatest for excellence before anyone even saw him play!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
