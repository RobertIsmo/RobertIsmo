<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot is happening all over the world. China&#39;s president Xi Jinping will be meeting with Russia&#39;s President Vladimir Putin and Ukraine&#39;s President Volodymyr Zelensky in an attempt to bring peace to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Slovakia and Poland have both pledged warplanes for Ukraine, highlighting the security concerns in the region.

In business news, there has been a lot of volatility in markets over the past week as investors worry about global economic stability. There are also some interesting developments regarding Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s strong ties to tech startups and how that affects investments.

In terms of science, new data suggests that the origins of the pandemic may be linked to raccoon dogs at a market in Wuhan, China. As for environmental news, this winter has brought a great deal of relief for California&#39;s drought situation, but experts warn that water woes still remain for the region. 

And finally, if you&#39;re a fan of sports then you know that there have been some major surprises in this week&#39;s NCAA tournaments. We&#39;ve already seen two Cinderella teams emerge with No. 15 Princeton&#39;s win against Arizona and No. 13 Furman upsetting No. 4 Virginia, so it&#39;ll be exciting to see what other upsets lie ahead!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
