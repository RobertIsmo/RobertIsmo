<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there have been a few troubling news stories. In the US, there was a 26-year-old coder who wrested an assault pistol from the hands of a gunman, potentially preventing much greater tragedy. People had been practicing a popular dance when the shooter carried out his rampage, and no one dared to flee. The city of Monterey Park has also been transforming the experience of Chinese Americans. 

At the same time, people have been examining how Kevin McCarthy has formed an ironclad bond with Marjorie Taylor Greene, and abroad in the Solomon Islands, China&#39;s mad dash into a strategic island nation is breeding resentment. Also in America, inflation is cooling, leaving many uncertain as to what comes next. Tragically, in New York Region an anesthesiologist made numerous life-threatening errors resulting in death; and so the IRS is attempting to bolster customer service as tax season starts. 

Finally, the Supreme Court is set to review bathroom bans for transgender youths; educators are struggling on how to handle students transitioning gender identity at school without informing parents; and Biden lawyers mistakenly thought classified files went to a think tank instead of his own garage. Lastly, Alex Murdaugh&#39;s trial will begin on Monday over murder of wife and son.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
