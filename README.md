<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is facing a lot of challenges right now. In the US, debt limit negotiators are debating spending caps in a standoff over tackling the national debt. Meanwhile, a breakthrough deal was made to keep the Colorado River from going dry but it expires soon. Conflict in Ukraine has led to the destruction of a city, and politicians in the US are trying to build an alliance against China while they tussle over who gets hold of microchips. At the same time, there is a movement to make working environments more menopause friendly and women are being offered new treatments for menopause symptoms. Plus, TikTok is suing Montana for passing a law banning them. While all this is happening, two politicians have announced their retirements: senator Tim Scott in South Carolina and senator Carper in Delaware.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
