<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of turmoil in the world right now. In the Middle East, both the US and Israeli intelligence sources say a Palestinian group is responsible for a hospital blast that resulted in hundreds of casualties. Another conflict is escalating in Tel Aviv, where President Biden visited and warned Israel not to go too far in responding to overwhelming grief and anger. In the US, Republican lawmakers are debating whether to give power to an acting House Speaker while they choose a new Speaker—and fear the move could cost them their majority in upcoming elections. Meanwhile, American households have seen a huge jump in wealth amid the pandemic due to stimulus packages, strong job markets, and stock&#x2F;home price increases. Lastly, there&#39;s some news in the Arts: Quavo of hip-hop trio Migos is releasing a solo album as he continues to mourn the death of his nephew and other victims of gun violence.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
