<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, a wildfire has destroyed a town in West Maui, leaving residents who are still nearby without much help from federal and local aid. Fortunately for some, their homes were saved, and private volunteers have stepped up to provide support for the survivors.

Elsewhere in the US, the pivot away from fossil fuels has been initiated and people are turning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind. This is met with resistance from both sides of the aisle, as well as environmentalist organizations. There is also a push for greater FDA approval of new sunscreen technology by Congress. 

Meanwhile, police have been raiding small newspapers in Kansas and parents in Houston schools have expressed concern over changes being made there - particularly closing libraries to create spaces for disruptive students to watch online lessons. 

Finally, we&#39;re seeing a shift in leadership in the New York Police Department&#39;s secretive intelligence unit with the appointment of Rebecca Weiner as its chief, as well as the potential appointment of David Weiss to investigate claims surrounding Hunter Biden - although some Republicans are now speaking out against it.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
