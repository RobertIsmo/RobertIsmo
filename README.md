<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In the US, there&#39;s been an investigation into how President Trump handled classified documents while in office at his Mar-A-Lago resort, as well as a big Supreme Court decision which backed voting rights for Black voters. Also in the US, former President Pat Robertson has sadly passed away, and there were some interesting developments around trademark dispute between Jack Daniel&#39;s and Bad Spaniels Silly Squeakers. Over in Ukraine, there have been multiple attacks against Russian occupiers by Western tanks and vehicles, and the country has also been severely affected by flooding recently. Lastly, Canada is dealing with hundreds of wildfires that are burning much larger than expected.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
