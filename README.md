<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is witnessing a lot of conflict over several issues. In the Middle East, there&#39;s a war going on between Israel and Hamas, and President Biden is heading to Israel to try and de-escalate the situation. Meanwhile, Russia and China are taking sides with the Palestinians. The US has been criticized for its strong support of Israel, even though Arab critics fear an imminent massacre of Palestinians. Closer to home, there are Republicans fighting against each other over the US Speaker position. And as tensions escalate in Ukraine, it&#39;s seen a deadly Russian missile attack on an apartment block that has killed two people. Lastly, Xi Jinping recently outlined his vision of a new world order with Vladimir Putin by his side.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
