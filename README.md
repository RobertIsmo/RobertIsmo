<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is facing a lot of legal battles related to former President Trump. A judge has ordered Trump&#39;s lawyers to get security clearances so they can handle classified information that will be fundamental to the trial. Meanwhile, an Airman was indicted on charges of mishandling US secrets after a leak. The Supreme Court also recently made a decision on a Native American adoption law and there are upcoming decisions to look out for from the court&#39;s new conservative majority. 

Elsewhere in the world, Ukrainian troops are fighting a grueling and costly counteroffensive against Russia while US lawmakers are preparing for a bitter spending fight that could lead to a government shutdown this fall. Lastly, Glenda Jackson, an Oscar-winning actress and politician who had a successful acting and political career, recently passed away at 87.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
