<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is ongoing tension between the US, Israel, and Ukraine. President Biden has been warning Israel that it is &#39;losing support&#39; over their war in Gaza, and the US vetoed a UN resolution for a ceasefire in the conflict. In the US, the Supreme Court has cleared a path for Democrats to redistrict American House seats in their favor and Republicans have begun an impeachment inquiry against Biden. Russia has also been brought into the fold, with Biden claiming that they are celebrating American divisions over providing aid to Ukraine. To complicate matters further, Republicans are now sidelining Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky by demanding border security in order to pass an economic aid package. On a lighter note, actor Andre Braugher recently passed away at 61 and received recognition for his role on Brooklyn Nine-Nine during his lifetime.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
