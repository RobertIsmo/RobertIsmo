<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been an eruption of violence in the Gaza conflict between Hamas and Israel, leaving many Palestinian Americans feeling abandoned and resulting in increased security around religious institutions and public spaces across the U.S. In addition, Jordan and Scott are dueling it out for house speaker amidst a Republican fight, and Senator Robert Menendez has been indicted on charges that highlight how Egypt’s powerful intelligence agency wields influence. Microsoft is also closing a 69 billion dollar Activision deal despite objections from regulators, and Chinese bitcoin mines are now drawing attention from U.S. national security scrutiny.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
