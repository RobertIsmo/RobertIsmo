<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, politicians and experts are divided on many topics. In the US, a law banning gender transition care for minors was just struck down, and there is a trial set for a case involving documents related to President Trump. Meanwhile, Hunter Biden has reached a deal to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges. On the international stage, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting Washington this week and there have been reports of Ukrainian prisoners of war being mistreated. In the business world, organizations are getting desperate to get their workers back in the office, with incentives like donations to charity or consequences like bad performance reviews. Finally, in New York there was a fatal fire at an e-bike shop near Chinatown caused by batteries.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
