<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is in a state of turmoil. In Israel, thousands of people were recently attacked by Hamas and many survivors are traumatized from the experience. In the US, there are protests in several cities calling for a ceasefire and lifting of the siege in Gaza, as well as a political battle between a governor and former president that is taking place in Florida. Meanwhile, in Ukraine there is a deadlocked war that is testing the morale of citizens and causing tension amongst their leaders. In Argentina, Haley and other candidates are trying to tackle the immigration issues they&#39;re facing but are facing challenges with logistics and laws. Lastly, there&#39;s also an A.I. entrepreneur in Senegal who is using technology to try and quash malaria. Closer to home, Phoenix recently dismantled their homeless encampment despite the city still facing an ongoing homeless crisis. For runners at the New York City Marathon, new accommodations like lactation tents are helping new moms on race day.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
