<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the United States, there was a Republican debate where Donald Trump was only given 10 minutes for questions from the moderators. At an event held at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, traditional Republicans looked forward to seeing what could be in store with a post-Trump era. On a different note, Rudy Giuliani (Donald Trump&#39;s former lawyer) surrendered at a Georgia jail when he was indicted for election fraud. There are also some incentives coming from Biden which are intended to shift the makeup of foreign investments. 

On a more technological level, there has been an increase in demand for artificial intelligence chips, helping Nvidia&#39;s revenue to double and possibly triple in their next quarter. A 30 year old woman who cannot speak due to a stroke is receiving treatment to help her communicate, using brain activity to control an avatar which speaks for her. 

India is continuing its success in space exploration as well, with Chandrayaan-3 mission succeeding and India becoming the first country to reach the lunar south polar region in one piece. There has also been a study about gender surgeries increasing almost threefold from 2016-2019 due to access broadening. 

There is even an update about two men convicted of a grisly murder in 1993 potentially getting new trials, all because someone theorized Richard Matt (who escaped prison during one of New York&#39;s most famous jailbreaks) was involved too. 

Overall it&#39;s been quite thematic with moral cowardice being displayed in different arenas and people pushing for change - politically, biologically, technologically - being successful!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
