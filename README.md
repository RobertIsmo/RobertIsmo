<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I have some news about what&#39;s happening in the world. A statement from the White House recently confirmed that a second set of classified documents have been found at Biden&#39;s Wilmington home. Additionally, inflation rates are up as rent prices stayed steady even though car prices dropped. The U.S. is also dealing with an egg supply shortage due to an avian flu outbreak and increasing costs of fuel and feed which has resulted in higher prices.

In China, officials are trying to take a more business-friendly approach to encourage economic growth by using more encouraging language. Back stateside, records and documents have revealed some irregularities concerning funds raised by George Santos who was recently elected to Congress. His résumé was found to be hiding lies that would have otherwise disqualified him for the position.

Lastly, there&#39;s a lot of travel news! A list of 52 places to go in 2023 was recently released, while worldwide the US is escalating its fight with China regarding outposts collecting intelligence across their own jurisdiction. On the domestic level, two NYC hospitals were on strike recently but fortunately, action and negotiations ended this recently. And finally, a young politician in Virginia named Glenn Youngkin may be considering running for president but his ambitions could be undermined by a divided state legislature.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
