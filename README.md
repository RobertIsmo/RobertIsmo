<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on right now in the world. A ruling invalidating the FDA&#39;s approval of an abortion pill has drug company leaders condemning it. In the US, Tennessee recently expelled two lawmakers for leading a gun control protest and then swore them back in as a swift rebuke to the Republican supermajority. There was also a shooting in Louisville, Kentucky with a gunman killing five co-workers that was livestreamed. Meanwhile, President Biden is finding it harder to broker new treaties in today&#39;s fractious world. In sports news, Aliyah Boston just became the second-ever top pick from her college in the WNBA draft and there are racial disparities in how its stars are showcased. Lastly, back in Virginia, a 6-year-old first grader who shot his teacher was charged with a crime and up in Manhattan there will be a hearing on Donald Trump with the Republican-led Judiciary Committee hoping to tarnish the Democratic prosecutor leading his case. Finally, Trump ignored a deadline to file personal financial disclosure to the FEC.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
