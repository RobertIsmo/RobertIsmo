<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Trump have an intense power struggle going on as Trump is exerting influence over his party and even in the country after the presidency in a way that has never been seen before. Meanwhile, Florida politician Matt Gaetz is sparking speculation about his plans to run for governor of Florida in 2026. For some good news, job gains surged, despite concerns from the Federal Reserve about inflation. Yields are jumping and stocks are swinging due to strong employment reports. 
Other news worth mentioning includes Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, New York Mayor Eric Adams traveling to Latin America to promote NYC while at the same time warning migrants about the dangers of coming there, a surge of Venezuelan migrants overwhelming Chicago, and a popular author Michael Lewis coming under scrutiny for his new book about a crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried. Finally, there are questions around U.S. Aid to Ukraine and how long it will last with decreased Republican support.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
