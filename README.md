<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of changes happening around the world right now. In the US, former President Donald Trump is making efforts to overturn the election, and Nikki Haley is competing in a one-sided primary. Meanwhile, Ukraine&#39;s marines are putting up a fight against Russia, and Vladimir Putin is leading Russians in civilizational conflict with the West. In China, President Xi Jinping&#39;s missile force is under scrutiny due to a purge. On the economic front, high interest rates are making it expensive to borrow money, and the controversial trucking firm Yellow that got a $700 million US bailout recently declared bankruptcy. To make things even more complicated, there are questions about whether Audubon has ties to slavery, and whether social justice applies to birds. Finally, the US women&#39;s team was eliminated from the Women&#39;s World Cup by only a millimeter!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
