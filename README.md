<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening in the world right now. The US Treasury Department has estimated that it will run out of cash by June 5, and the White House and Republicans are trying to come to an agreement on raising the debt ceiling or else face a possible default. There is also a vote set for this weekend on the impeachment of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, and recently an Oath Keepers leader was sentenced to 18 years in prison for a rarely charged crime. On top of that, there&#39;s been discussion about the changing culture in the Hamptons, and how increasingly strict housing rules are turning away younger people from wanting to live there. We&#39;re also seeing evidence that Russia may be using flooding as a tactic of war, and behind it all is a blockbuster novel about video games doing incredibly well in sales. Finally, Ashley Judd is sharing her reflections on her year of grief after losing her mother, who died by suicide.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
