<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Due to fears about the global economy and the risks in the financial system, there is a lot of volatility in stocks, bonds, and other assets. This week there have been debates about whether &#39;wokeness&#39; was a factor in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In terms of health, pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 so it&#39;s important for them to know the risks associated with it. As for geopolitical news, South Korean President Moon Jae-in recently visited Tokyo which is a sign of an improving diplomatic relationship between the two countries. Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are both trying to restock their munitions for a possible spring counteroffensive. The Pentagon chief also spoke to his Russian counterpart about a drone incident. On the technology front, Microsoft&#39;s Bing chatbot is using artificial intelligence to pick out brackets while OpenAI released a language model called GPT-4 that is both impressive and concerning. Finally, France is debating a pension reform bill which has sparked large protests. The US is also pushing for TikTok, the popular video app owned by ByteDance, to be sold in order to address national security concerns.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
