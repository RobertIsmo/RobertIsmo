<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a series of shootings in Lewiston, Maine, and authorities are still searching for a suspect. The US economy is booming with an increase in consumer spending, but there are concerns that the high interest rates may affect the economic outlook. In Israel, police officers armed with only handguns faced off against Hamas forces. The Republican Jewish Coalition is gathering in Las Vegas to discuss the unique challenges facing Israel and American Jewry. A hard-right social and fiscal agenda is set to be introduced by the new House Speaker Mike Johnson from Louisiana oil country, who does not believe in climate change. Meanwhile, Donald Trump&#39;s allies are either distancing themselves, or cooperating with investigations against him. Scientists around the world are watching climate change impact their work and research, while a new street food has made its way to New York City and sparking a variety of imitators all within one city block.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
