<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In Ukraine, China has been cashing in on their trade with Russia this year, which exceeded $200 billion. In the US, Donald Trump&#39;s ballot eligibility is being heavily challenged and the Supreme Court cases could have a profound impact on the 2024 election. In addition, Harvard has found more instances of plagiarism in president Claudine Gay&#39;s work, while in Oklahoma, a man was just recently exonerated after serving a 48-year long wrongful murder sentence. On the world stage, Israel has been battering Gaza in an attempt to destroy Hamas but the ceasefire talks have bogged down over disputes about aid inspections. Moreover, the Polish right is occupying State TV and refusing to accept their loss of power. It&#39;s definitely an interesting time we&#39;re living in!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
