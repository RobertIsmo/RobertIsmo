<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In the US, Hunter Biden, President Biden&#39;s son, has been indicted on gun charges and House Republicans are impeaching him. Meanwhile, politicians in other countries are charging millions of dollars to send people to the US, something the Biden administration is trying to end. 

The US may also soon have a government shutdown due to differences between far-right Republicans and Speaker McCarthy, and there is the possibility of a UAW strike at the Detroit Auto Show. To add to this, the Treasury Secretary has announced new sanctions against Russia and thousands of people have been affected by floods in Libya. 

President Biden has criticized Republicans for undercutting working-class Americans and Florida&#39;s Governor DeSantis has spread vaccine skepticism by contradicting the CDC. Chris Christie is making a big bet on doing well in New Hampshire and Utah Republican Mitt Romney&#39;s retirement coincides with the publication of a book that slams his party and Senate. Finally, there is an ongoing trial in New York involving a fisherman accused of taking too many fish from the sea off Montauk.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
