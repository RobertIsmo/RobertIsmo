<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some major developments in the world recently. In Israel, there were a series of attacks by Hamas that shocked officials and shattered the country&#39;s sense of security. In the business world, car manufacturers have recently closed tentative agreements for their autoworkers, resulting in the most generous contracts in decades. In US politics, there is a debate over whether Donald Trump is disqualified from running for president again because of a clause in the 14th Amendment. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is defending his company against a federal antitrust case, and residents of New York City have contributed to an extremely detailed map of its neighborhoods. There is also conflict in Ukraine, where both sides are paying a bloody price for control of the city of Avdiivka. And unfortunately, we lost Matthew Perry recently. Fans have been mourning him at a Friends museum in NYC that re-creates the sitcom&#39;s famous sets. </p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
