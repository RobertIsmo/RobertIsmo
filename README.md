<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. Ukrainian President Zelensky is in the US making a case for more aid and thanking Western nations for their support. Singapore is rethinking its sweltering urban areas to lower the effects of climate change, while former Donald Trump aide Mark Meadows has testified in a Georgia court case with mixed results. Steven Calabresi, co-founder of the Federalist Society, has reversed his opinion on whether Trump can serve again after the 14th Amendment. Meanwhile, an immigrant community is reeling from a sheriff deputy shooting two teens, and businesses are introducing &quot;Woke Free&quot; products with an anti-liberal agenda. Iran said they expect a prisoner exchange with the US today as President Biden and Ebrahim Raisi of Iran prepare to attend the UN General Assembly meeting. Iraq&#39;s leader is heading there too to pitch himself as a face of change and focus attention on climate change, sovereign debt relief and development goals.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
