<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world, the G20 has invited the African Union to join, continuing the rise of the Global South. In the US, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows&#39; was denied a request to move his Georgia case to federal court. In addition, former President Trump gave his first post-fourth indictment rally in South Dakota. On an international level, Myanmar&#39;s coup has been resisted by a former rock star turned bodyguard who now directs films. Meanwhile, Elon Musk refused to enable Ukraine drone attacks on Russia&#39;s fleet. Corporate America continues to find risks and rewards in doing business in China. In Pennsylvania, a manhunt is underway for an escaped prisoner near a botanical garden in Philadelphia, and in sports Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka are playing for the U.S. Open Championship while Daniil Medvedev faces Novak Djokovic in the men&#39;s singles final. Additionally, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a Zulu Nationalist and one-time rival of Nelson Mandela passed away at age 95.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
