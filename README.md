<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of issues going on in the world right now. A border crossing for aid between Syria and Turkey is closed, leaving Syria unable to receive direct aid from many countries due to sanctions. Earthquakes have been happening in Turkey due to its Anatolian Fault System. There&#39;s a professional soccer player who was rescued from the rubble in Turkey only hours after scoring the winning goal for his team. In the U.S., there are tensions between China and America that could potentially affect housing purchases. Biden is giving his first State of the Union address since the G.O.P took over the House and will be asking for higher taxes and more social aid for those in need. George Santos invited a guest to the State of the Union and is trying to use it as an opportunity to raise awareness about 9&#x2F;11 rescue workers health issues. Conversation hearts for Valentine&#39;s Day are different this year as we &quot;speak volumes about the lives and loves&quot; during these difficult times. The Homeland Security Secretary is also under fire from Republicans over the US-Mexico border crisis. A.I.-generated personas have been detected in state-aligned information campaigns, opening a new chapter in online manipulation. There is an unsubstantiated case of Nazi loot somewhere inside a Swiss collector&#39;s massive collection, including 6,000 oils, some grenades and Napoleon’s toothbrush.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
