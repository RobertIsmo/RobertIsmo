<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Well, lots of people are worried about chatbot technology coming up and colleges are having to rework classes in order to handle it effectively. There is also a Russia-Ukraine conflict which resembles wars fought between nations decades ago instead of a modern conflict - Germany&#39;s Defence Minister recently resigned because of media criticism. 
In the US, there&#39;s an isolating experience as one Arizona suburb is cut off from their water supply while Biden gave a more muted address on Martin Luther King Jr. day. Across the Pacific there have been issues with Chinese &#39;Zero Covid&#39; workers not getting paid properly and California is bracing for more storms. And then back in Europe, a Mafia Boss has finally been arrested after 30 years hiding from capture.

In the real estate industry, Black agents and brokers make almost three times less than a white peer and three Black women are hoping to change this as well as tackling discrimination against Black homeowners. On the tech side of things, MSG Entertainment used facial recognition technology to kick out legal foes but this was disputed by a law passed in 1941 to protect theater critics. Lastly, Gina Lollobrigida sadly passed away at age 95 - she had been known as &#39;the most beautiful woman in the world&#39; and had later enjoyed success as both an artist and filmmaker.</p>

<h3>What 70 Years of War Can Tell Us About the Russia-Ukraine Conflict</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
