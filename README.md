<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I have some interesting news for you! The United Automobile Workers union has announced that they are expanding their strikes at Ford and GM. This is a protest for better working conditions and wages. Also, Dianne Feinstein, the longest-serving female Senator from California, has passed away. Her death leaves a vacancy in her seat with Democrats running to fill it. 

There&#39;s also some trouble happening with national parks closing due to a shut down. This has been an issue as it affects home sales in flood-prone areas as Congress may not be able to fund the necessary flood insurance program. On the global scale, mosquitoes have been increasing in population - climate change and rapid evolution making them more of a public health threat lately. In Africa specifically, there&#39;s an invasive species that carries malaria, and scientists are experimenting with new ways to keep them from spreading further. Lastly, inflation measured by the Federal Reserve cooled in August, but this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean prices are going down.</p>

<h3>Mosquitoes Are a Growing Public Health Threat, Reversing Years of Progress</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
