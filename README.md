<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There currently seems to be a lot of news about politics in the US. Maine has joined Colorado in determining that Donald Trump is ineligible to appear on the primary ballot. The US Supreme Court has been asked to make a decision on Trump&#39;s eligibility by Super Tuesday. Over in Israel, an investigation has revealed acts of sexual violence committed by Hamas, and Israel has expressed regret for civilian casualties due a recent airstrike. Additionally, a young Israeli-American woman is thought to have been killed on October 7th by Hamas, although her body has not yet been recovered. 
In the US, Nikki Haley&#39;s avoidance of mentioning slavery as a cause of the conflict has put tension on the coalition she was building between independents and moderate Democrats. Furthermore, young Iowa Republicans are raising their voices in an effort to get their party to really listen. Meanwhile, a federal judge has approved Georgia&#39;s new voting maps and the Justice Department is threatening to sue Texas over a law that will allow for more migrant arrests.

Lastly, there&#39;s an article about Stephanie Courtney who is better known as &quot;Flo&quot; from Progressive insurance ads. There’s also an article about how Milana Vayntrub, one of Progressive’s spokeswomen, began receiving leering internet trolls after gaining fame from her ad campaigns.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
