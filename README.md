<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there are a lot of different issues happening around the world right now. For example, Tropical Storm Idalia is causing a lot of upheaval and wind speeds as it moves across the US. Inflation around the globe has been slowing down recently, but there&#39;s some uncertainty about how stable it will be in the long term. The US and China have started to talk again about economic topics, although it&#39;s unclear what will come out of those discussions. Germany is sending old tanks to help bolster Ukraine&#39;s front lines. In Texas prison, some death row inmates are playing Dungeons and Dragons as a way to stay connected with one another and their imaginations. Trump is facing a lawsuit that accuses him of over-reporting his assets by $2.2 billion, and he gave a deposition in the case where he talked about avoiding “nuclear holocaust” among other topics. There has been a massive fire in Johannesburg that has killed many people, and authorities are looking into what caused it. The Pope has made some strong remarks about US Catholics lately due to disagreements about Church practices and beliefs. Finally, there is a heat wave in Mexico that is causing migrants to die from heat exhaustion, plus there have been rare protests in Syria in recent weeks against the authoritarian government.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
