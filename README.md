<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In China, foreign businesses are facing increased security scrutiny as the country reopens. Meanwhile, videos about poverty are being censored by the government. In Montana, the conservative right is led by one particular family. In Turkey, corruption has created a construction system that is causing families to become wealthy off of it. The luxury handbag market is changing due to &quot;superfake&quot; handbags that $10,000 Chanel bags and $200 knockoffs. PacWest is considering selling a loan portfolio after its shares plummeted and HSBC is trying to keep itself together from being split up by Ping An&#39;s Chinese insurer. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank has raised rates and in Moscow, there have been explosions with Ukraine denying involvement. In Britain, their economy needs a boost and there is a big generation divide regarding their monarchy. Lastly, Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s text messages have revealed his racial ideologies.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
