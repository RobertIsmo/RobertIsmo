<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing a challenege from opposition parties after two decades in power. In Ukraine, fighting for a city called Bakhmut is the longest and bloodiest battle since the war began, with Russia still controlling the largely ruined city. In the US, economic hardship, climate change, political instability, and gang violence are all contributing to more people migrating to the US. Companies are now thinking differently about diversity and inclusion, using different terminology to discuss it. In Kenya, hundreds of followers of a pastor&#39;s End Times preaching have been drawn to starve themselves in an attempt to meet Jesus. A group of conservative operatives have raised millions of dollars through pro-police and pro-veteran robocalls, but have not used the money to promote causes or candidates as expected. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams is causing conflict amongst left leaning New Yorkers with his push towards more conservative issues such as policing and providing shelter. On the Right there is support and donations pouring in for Daniel Penny who was charged with killing Jordan Neely but labelled a hero by conservative political figures. Family wealth in America is currently soaring making it the greatest wealth transfer in history yet reinforcing family inequality. India is trying to eradicate witch hunting which has become a tool for oppressing women violently. Meg Jay has written about how 20-somethings should use this time of life to figure out what they want out of their futures. Finally in France, it&#39;s strange that the far right are being looked at as adults when it comes to protesting led by unions that should be beneficial for the left.</p>

<h3>He Told Followers to Starve to Meet Jesus. Why Did So Many Do It?</h3>

<h3>How to Raise $89 Million in Small Donations, and Make It Disappear</h3>
<sub>By David A. Fahrenthold, Tiff Fehr and Charlie Smart</sub>
<p>A group of conservative operatives using sophisticated robocalls raised millions of dollars from donors using pro-police and pro-veteran messages. But instead of using the money to promote issues and candidates, an analysis by The New York Times shows, nearly all the money went to pay the firms making the calls and the operatives themselves.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/42RRXZP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
