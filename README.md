<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are pretty chaotic in the world right now. There&#39;s a lot of conflict and tension between Russia and Ukraine, as Moscow has expanded its missile production despite sanctions and Ukraine recently fired missiles at the facilities of Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. Sadly, there has also been a lot of natural disaster recently: floods in Libya have killed more than 5,000 people recently, while an earthquake hit Morocco and flattened villages. Adding to the chaos, former President Trump is encouraging Republican lawmakers to impeach President Biden despite little evidence to back up their allegations. On a lighter note, New York City is building its first new performance center for the arts at Ground Zero since 9&#x2F;11! Finally, abortion rights are unexpectedly on the ballot in a few places - and winning - which is an encouraging change from the status quo.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
