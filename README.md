<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, federal officials have relaxed rules around past drug use in order to attract younger workers. A law school has been cultivating close ties with justices and offering generous pay to gain influence. The Pope is on a secret mission of peace in Ukraine, and in San Francisco there are ongoing social problems caused by the pandemic. In New York, there&#39;s a secret penthouse full of fun events and elite schools are re-focusing on mental health. In business news, regulators are preparing to seize and sell First Republic Bank and states are trying to protect minors online. Globally, Sudan&#39;s healthcare system is collapsing due to hospital closures, while Norway has immortalized Freya the walrus as a sculpture to remind us of our need to coexist with nature. Lastly, Japan is considering saying goodbye to its baseball past by redeveloping stadiums.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
