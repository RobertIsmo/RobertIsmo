<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening across the world right now. In the US, the threat to the budget has receded, and a federal court has struck down Alabama&#39;s congressional map. On the global front, North Korea is likely to seek more missile and warhead technology in an upcoming visit to Russia, while Kenya is offering to send boots on the ground to help the security crisis in Haiti. Meanwhile, China is dominating the car market at Munich’s auto show and Americans are losing faith in college education value. In science news, two astronomers have traveled 13.8 billion years back in time and archaeologists have found remains of a suspected child revenant!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
