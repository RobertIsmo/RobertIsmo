<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like US politics and international relations are dominating the news this week. In the US, Democrats in Congress are facing pressure from the left to push for a cease-fire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Meanwhile, President Biden is confronting limits to his influence in two conflicts - with Israel and Ukraine. On the domestic front, voters are dreading a possible Trump-Biden rematch in November&#39;s election, while Biden&#39;s economic policies so far are mixed. Worldwide, King Charles III of Britain gave a speech at odds with his own beliefs that highlighted his country&#39;s commitment to further fossil fuel extraction.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
