<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news about gun violence lately. In Texas, several people were killed in mass shootings but there have been no changes to gun laws as a result. Similarly, a mystery shooter left 9 people dead in Allen, Texas, yet efforts to combat the spread of these images going viral on social media failed.

In the UK, the new royal crowning ceremony and upcoming election have caused some unrest among citizens. In the US, there has also been tension surrounding Eric Adams&#39; plan to move asylum seekers to suburbs, which several suburban communities rejected. On top of that, police are investigating a car crash in Texas involving migrants--it&#39;s unclear whether or not the incident was intentional.

Finally, the Los Angeles Dodgers may be on the brink of returning some property back to families who were previously forced off their land to create Dodger Stadium in the 1950s.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
