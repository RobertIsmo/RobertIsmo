<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot of different things are happening across the world right now. In the US, a prominent lawyer is being sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and son. There&#39;s a lot of tension and fighting in Ukraine, where their forces are trying to protect a city that has taken on deep symbolic resonance. Germany&#39;s chancellor is in Washington visiting President Biden, which is sparking speculation as to what they might discuss - with many wondering about the &#39;end game&#39; of the war. Several people have been arrested for entering an abandoned rifle factory in Albania and this has been causing suspicions about Moscow. In Tennessee, drag shows will be banned on public property and Black equestrians are struggling to find helmets that fit their natural hair. Lastly, dolphins and whales have been found using vocal fry - which apparently involves making squiggly sounds underwater!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
