<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of developments happening around the world right now. In the US, former President Trump is a target of investigation due to his handling of classified documents. There has been chaos in the House as far-right rebels continue their mutiny against House Leader McCarthy and the government had to do a large debt ceiling stand-off due to a trillion dollar borrowing binge. On top of that, smoke shrouded New York City earlier this week and there were wild fires in California and floods in Ukraine which caused havoc. Soccer star Lionel Messi just announced he was joining Miami&#39;s Inter Miami soccer team. To cap it all off, Saudi Arabia&#39;s $700 billion wealth fund just invested in golf.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
