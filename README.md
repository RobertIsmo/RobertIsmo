<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In North Carolina, there&#39;s been a major change in the way legislative and congressional maps are seen due to the shift in party control of their Supreme Court. Meanwhile here in the US, Montana just passed a law preventing transgender minors from receiving certain medical care while New York State is making changes to their bail laws to give judges more discretion. Internationally, we&#39;ve started evacuating civilians from Sudan following an outbreak of fighting and there&#39;s been a deadly Russian attack on Ukrainian cities resulting in at least 25 deaths. To top it all off, E.U. countries have extended tariff waivers for Ukrainian grain, despite some protests. In our own country, we&#39;ve got Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy trying to bridge divisions among Republican factions, along with disturbing cases of homelessness such as that of former Bend Mayor Craig Coyner. And finally, Biden will be doing something rare for a president by attending this weekend&#39;s White House Correspondents&#39; Association dinner.</p>

<h3>North Carolina Gerrymander Ruling Reflects Politicization of Judiciary Nationally</h3>
<sub>By Michael Wines</sub>
<p>When it had a Democratic majority last year, the North Carolina Supreme Court voided the state’s legislative and congressional maps as illegal gerrymanders.

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
