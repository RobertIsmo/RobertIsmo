<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, schools are receiving billions in stimulus funds to help kids recover from learning loss caused by the pandemic, but the results have been mixed. In Ukraine, Nazi symbols are appearing on the front lines, which could be used as propaganda and spread imagery that the West has been trying to get rid of for years. On top of that, Twitter&#39;s U.S ad sales have dropped drastically and they&#39;re not looking up any time soon. On the theatre side of things, actors nominated for the Tony Award talked about their craft and why they act. India is having issues with money for show horses instead of work horses being prioritized for train travel, even after a disaster just happened. There&#39;s an even bigger issue in Britain with a for-profit school called Oxford Business College making millions off of immigrant students without proper oversight from British education system. In Benin there&#39;s debate over who should own a bunch of valuable Bronzes found there. Here in America, New York City is trying to find ways to tackle their persisting problem of fare evasion using technology. In California&#39;s Central Valley there&#39;s a new resistance movement springing up to make positive changes in terms of its environmental problems and deep inequality. This week former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley did a CNN Town Hall discussing her experience and vision, while 3 new candidates announced their bid for the 2024 Republicans Presidential nomination - Chris Christie, Mike Pence and Doug Burgum. Finally at University of Texas at Austin there&#39;s a Methodist campus ministry whose mission is to spread inclusive love and provides a safe haven for all students.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
