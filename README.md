<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now: the debt ceiling deal has sparked G.O.P. revolts in the U.S., with people opposed to a provision allowing a controversial pipeline project; Russia is dealing with a drone strike in Moscow as part of their ongoing involvement in the Ukraine War; China has an extremely high youth unemployment rate and they are encouraging citizens to ‘eat bitterness’; and Turkish elections have provided a warning about Donald Trump’s leadership. In addition, some science-based stories include testing New York apartments for air pollution, Elizabeth Holmes heading off to prison for a more than 11-year sentence, and even after being debunked, the ‘Sybil’ story still holds its grip 50 years later. If you’re looking for something to escape into this summer, there are plenty of books out there to pick from!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
