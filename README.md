<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is dealing with a lot of big issues right now. To start, many countries are still trying to get the pandemic under control. In the United States, there was recently a report from a congressional investigation into the Capitol riot which blamed it on former President Donald J. Trump’s “multipart plan” to overturn the 2020 election. Meanwhile, Ukraine recently visited Washington seeking military aid; the Biden administration chose not to provide the desired assistance. In Europe, Christmas Markets have returned in Germany but shoppers are being more cautious because of economic uncertainty. China is also facing controversy over its Covid death toll, which is suspected of being far higher than what China claims. 

It’s not all bad news though because people can still find ways to celebrate safely this holiday season and Santa has been surprisingly successful despite these trying times. Additionally, there may be some new changes coming to retirement plans like Roth IRA&#39;s and 401ks in 2021. Finally, more women are exploring egg-freezing as an option to preserve their fertility options even as they delay having children while they focus on their careers.</p>

<h3>As Cases Explode, China’s Low Covid Death Toll Convinces No One</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
