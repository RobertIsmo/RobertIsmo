<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, a lot is happening around the world. In the US, five police officers have been charged with murder in the death of 29-year old Tyre Nichols, whose last encounter with police authorities was caught on video footage that is reported to be &#39;absolutely appalling&#39;. Additionally, President Trump&#39;s Justice Department&#39;s quest to find flaws in the Russia inquiry unraveled, while a farmworker in Half Moon Bay described coming face to face with a gunman who shot his co-worker dead alongside two other farmworkers.

In New York, a man was convicted for carrying out a terror attack which killed 8 people on a Manhattan bike path. There is also good news for the US economy as it gained momentum at the end of the year, despite recession fears.

Meanwhile in the worldwide sports scene, American golfer Anthony Kim decided to walk away from golf despite being compared to Tiger Woods. Russia has also conducted airstrikes in Ukraine killing 12 people, while UNESCO is attempting to preserve Odesa, designating it as a world heritage site after shelling by Russia. Finally, back in the US, the New York Public Library recently acquired Joan Didion&#39;s papers and China is cracking down on protesters engaging in rare rebuke of Xi Jinping&#39;s rule and hoping to discourage others from being emboldened by them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
