<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like a lot of things are happening in the world - from people risking their lives to prevent further violence or protect others like Brandon Tsay did, to countries struggling with the economic effects of inflation. In the US, the new Republican majority and former President Trump&#39;s influence continues to loom over politics, while Arizona is setting up for a Democratic senatorial run. Other places around the world are dealing with violent conflicts, like Russia and Ukraine. Even the simple act of providing meals to employees during work has changed as buildings remain empty. Technology companies are also being hit hard by the economy, leading even giants like Spotify and Microsoft to have layoffs and invest heavily in new projects.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
