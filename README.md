<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p> 
The world is facing some challenging times right now. We&#39;ve recently seen the death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, a tycoon and an ally to Putin who helped build a paramilitary force that fought alongside Russia. This has led to questions about the future of the mercenary group he was associated with. In other news, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has made some controversial remarks that have raised fears that Europe&#39;s pro-Putin sentiment may grow stronger.

Meanwhile, in the US, there is much happening. The Air Force is now using A.I. technology to help pilots in aerial combat. Also, tragedy struck Jacksonville, Florida this week when 3 Black people were killed and the gunman, who was white, later committed suicide as authorities investigate it as a hate crime. In addition, labor groups are lobbying and putting pressure on Hyundai and President Biden&#39;s administration to transition to electric vehicles and protect workers in the process. There&#39;s also been a clash between Vivek Ramaswamy and Mike Pence which speaks to an ideological difference within the Republican party.

Finally, there are some interesting sights on the sports front too. Novak Djokovic is currently back in New York loving it more than ever before while Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula enter the US Open looking really strong ahead of tryouts for home-country pressure.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
