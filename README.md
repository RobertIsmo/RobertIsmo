<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, President Biden&#39;s poll numbers remain relatively low, but due to structural advantages Democrats are optimistic that he has a strong position going into the next election. Experts are weighing in on the health implications of a president that would finish his second term being 86 years old. Early polls show a close race between Biden and potential Republican rivals. Fox News and CNN have made recent decisions to let go of two stars that were controversial throughout Trump&#39;s presidency. Businesses are weighing the costs and benefits of terminating Tucker Carlson&#39;s contracts given his notoriety. In Ukraine, volunteers are running missions to reunite families separated during Russia&#39;s hostile takeovers. Harry Belafonte, a groundbreaking singer, actor, and civil rights activist passed away at 96 years old. Dr. Anthony Fauci recently gave an in depth interview about the mistakes made throughout the pandemic and the decisions that will shape his legacy. The movie Rust recently resumed production in Montana with safety precautions following a fatal shooting that occurred when cast members were rehearsing with fake guns. A new study shows rising temperatures are creating new and unexpected heatwaves in regions that haven&#39;t experienced it before and office landlords in Manhattan have had to deal with a double blow from remote work and rising interest rates which could have serious implications for the city and country economically.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
