<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a number of news stories in the world recently about business, travel, US politics, and world affairs. On the business front, the Federal Aviation Administration has ordered some Boeing 737 Max 9 jets to be grounded following an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon. In the travel space, passengers have been learning more about the aircraft involved in this incident and how airlines are responding. In US politics, Donald Trump and President Biden are presenting the election as a battle for democracy with contrasting views. With regard to corporate PACs, there has been an analysis showing how companies have rethought their political donations in light of the Capitol attack. Meanwhile, Michigan Republicans are embroiled in a dispute over their party leader&#39;s removal. On the world stage, shipping companies are facing difficult choices after attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel in response to violence in Beirut. In terms of technology, one person has chosen to switch from a smartphone to a flip-phone for one month to curb her addiction. Finally, Harvard is dealing with the fallout from its controversial president&#39;s departure and Hollywood is divided over how to handle discussion around the Israel-Hamas conflict during awards season.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
