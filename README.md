<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! US politics are a big focus - President Biden predicted chaos at the border, but instead it turned out to be much quieter than expected. The Treasury Department has warned that the government may run out of money to pay bills by June 1, and VP Mike Pence is possibly preparing for a 2024 run using more of Ronald Reagan&#39;s playbook. Businesses are also looking into alternatives to Chinese manufacturers, particularly for electric car batteries. Real estate news takes us to England where entire communities are being flooded by the coastline and homeowners have to grapple with difficult decisions about leaving their homes behind. In technology, Microsoft is claiming to have developed an AI that exhibits signs of human reasoning. Lastly, in relationships, couples therapists are seeing breakthroughs as ideas about BLM and #MeToo have been incorporated into therapy. Finally, in international news, Turkey&#39;s President Erdogan appears likely to remain in power despite recent natural disasters and their shift towards one-man rule. Meanwhile, Netflix&#39;s hit show &quot;The Diplomat&quot; has thrilled many top officials (and Britain&#39;s ambassador) enough to get them calling up the real-life counterpart of the main character for conversations about plot implausibilities!</p>

<h3>Can the World Make an Electric Car Battery Without China?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
