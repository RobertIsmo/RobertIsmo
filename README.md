<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the Middle East there is a conflict between Israel and Palestine that has changed how people are viewing it. There are double standards in western actions in Gaza and Ukraine that are causing resentment. In the US, there is no Speaker of the House. This has led to some long-term concerns about Republican leadership. The United Automobile Workers union is striking for better wages at a Ram plant in Michigan, and non-union workers are also playing a big part. On the SATs, there is a deep inequality between rich and poor children that starts very early. Additionally, drug companies are making billions from weight-loss treatments even though they don&#39;t cost what people think they do. Finally, there have been fake Trump signs as well as a fight over them in a wealthy town which lasted years. 
Another positive point is that Philadelphia&#39;s dining scene is having a moment, with great pizza, fried chicken and French cuisine!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
