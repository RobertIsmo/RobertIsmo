<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like the former president Trump is likely to go before a grand jury in Georgia next week over election interference charges. Meanwhile, Florida governor DeSantis has made some changes to his campaign staff as Donald Trump&#39;s influence in the presidential front-runner race grows. 

On the international news front, tensions in the Black Sea have risen as the war in Ukraine continues and the implications of it have become more clear. Additionally, Afghanistan&#39;s resistance movement to the Taliban is no match for their military might. 

Closer to home, several severe storms have caused major damage and disruption in the Eastern US, while New York city officials had some trouble with crowd control when a social media personality gave out free game consoles! 

In sports news, female athletes are fighting for what they wear on the court and are leading a charge against body image scrutiny. Unfortunately, US Women&#39;s Soccer lost recently, only to be taunted by former president Trump himself!

Finally, there&#39;s some good health news - A new weight loss drug has been proven to reduce risk of heart problems too.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
