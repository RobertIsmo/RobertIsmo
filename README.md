<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there has been a lot of unrest in Ukraine as both sides prepare to attack after months of slowly escalating fighting. Russia has responded by cutting oil output in response to Western sanctions, which has caused the price of oil to go up. To add to the instability, the prime minister of Moldova, a neighbor of Ukraine that is also affected by the war, recently stepped down.

In Turkey, an earthquake caused massive destruction and the death toll surpasses 22,000 amidst a struggle to provide aid to the victims. Closer to home, the FBI is searching VP Mike Pence&#39;s home in Indiana. Additionally, Jinger Duggar Vuolo revisited her religious upbringing and became a powerful voice for young adults re-examining their conservative Christian childhoods.

Congressman Fetterman is recovering from a near-fatal stroke and adapting to life in the Senate as legislature adapts to accommodate him. Meanwhile, some conservatives have embraced a new kind of welfare policy that pushes Republicans away from Reagan-era family policy and towards providing direct cash support for families. Other Republicans have targeted press freedom by aiming to roll back Supreme Court decisions that protect journalists from defamation accusations. Lastly, electric vehicles are becoming more affordable this year thanks to competition and government incentives.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
