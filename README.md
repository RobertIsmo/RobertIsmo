<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The US has sent arms stored in Israel to Ukraine, and Germany has a new defense minister. US Democrats have taken back control of some state governments in the midterms, and the US Treasury Secretary may soon need to use accounting maneuvers to prevent defaulting on debt. China&#39;s shrinking population is causing concern for its economy, as well as for countries around the world. In New York, Republican congressman George Santos has made staff hires and appearances with members of the House Freedom Caucus, and he recently landed two committee appointments. And in India, there are many obstacles for single women to renting apartments.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
