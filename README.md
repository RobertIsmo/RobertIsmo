<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of activity happening in the US. Former President Donald Trump has been arraigned on documents and obstruction charges and is facing federal prosecution. He is also still dominating the news cycle, with Fox News calling President Biden a &#39;wannabe dictator.&#39; Meanwhile, in Ukraine, they are on the offense following Russia&#39;s occupation of their territory. Russian soldiers have been accused of war crimes, and in Little Bangladesh in Brooklyn, tradition is being embraced along with new trends. In New York City&#39;s Adams administration, there&#39;s been an exodus of top officials due to the mayor&#39;s management style. Also regarding housing, affordable housing woes are painting a &#39;bleak picture.&#39; And if you own a home, insurance rates are soaring as disasters caused by weather become more frequent. You can take certain steps to get more affordable insurance coverage though.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
