<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on around the world recently! In the US, a Supreme Court ruling on a migrant expulsion policy and Southwest Airlines cancellations have caused travel disruption and distress. In Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing to the US to escape poverty and repression. In Western New York, many families are mourning deaths as a result of storms. Then, in Congress, Republican Jewish Coalition has criticised newly-elected Representative George Santos for falsehoods about his heritage. And in pop culture, men are dismantling traditional gender roles. It&#39;s been an eventful year!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
