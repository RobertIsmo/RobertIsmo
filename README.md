<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, Russian forces have been using up their reserves trying to take control of the city Bakhmut, but at a high cost in Ukrainian lives. Finland is considering joining NATO in a move that would be a diplomatic and strategic setback for Russia. Russia has also detained an American journalist from the Wall Street Journal, claiming he was involved in espionage. Meanwhile, Middle Eastern police forces are beginning to use artificial intelligence to help with their policing efforts. Publishers are worried because AI chatbots may reduce how often people visit their websites. And there is discussion about how to use AI chatbots like ChatGPT, which can generate larger language models with better results. On top of all this, nine soldiers were killed after two army helicopters collided over Kentucky and Florida&#39;s Disney World has sidestepped the Governor&#39;s oversight board without anyone noticing until recently. Lastly, JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon has led an effort to raise $30 billion for First Republic Bank and President Biden has called for increased oversight of certain banks due to Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s failure earlier this month.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
