<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things have been quite busy lately. In Morocco, there was a big earthquake that caused major damage in cities and towns. In Vietnam, President Biden visited and was strengthening ties between the two countries as they have common concerns over Beijing&#39;s assertiveness in the region. In sports, Novak Djokovic won the U.S. Open and gained a 24th Grand Slam Title, and newcomer Coco Gauff also made her claim at the same event. In Spain, their top soccer official resigned due to an unwanted world cup kiss. In the UK, families have been cut off due to a crisis with unsafe lightweight concrete being used in schools. In Pennsylvania, a fugitive has been on the run and appeared with a new look miles away from where he was last seen. It&#39;s unclear yet why he had not been deported when facing a murder charge in Brazil.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
