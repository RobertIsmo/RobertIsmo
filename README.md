<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of conflict happening across the globe right now. In Syria, we have reports that a US contractor was killed and six other Americans were wounded following an attack. Closer to home here in the US, there&#39;s been a ruling that former Trump officials need to testify in an inquiry into the 2020 election. There&#39;s also a potential legal showdown between the Manhattan district attorney and House Republicans, as they argue over oversight power. In sports, there are no top seeds left in the tournaments after Alabama and Houston were knocked out in rapid succession. Back in the US, Los Angeles school and 30,000 workers have finally agreed on terms after a strike. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine and Russia are facing battles in Bakhmut as well as demands for Russia to pay for rebuilding costs. Here in New York City, we&#39;re looking back on the colorful history of a townhouse at 64 East Seventh Street, from tragedy to Yoko Ono. Lastly, in Israel there&#39;s a crisis underway that is testing Biden and Netanyahu&#39;s complicated ties, while military reservists have been avoiding volunteer duty which could cause military operations to scale back.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
