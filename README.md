<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like a lot of tough decisions need to be made in the US. Biden is attempting to introduce a budget that will pass Congress, but it&#39;s likely to be a difficult process. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a growing debate on how to balance the budget without cuts to popular programs or raising taxes. 

Meanwhile, Russia is in the midst of remaking its institutions and culture according to a militaristic worldview. Alongside this, there&#39;s been recent curiosity ahead of an upcoming film reviving the legacy of Elvis Presley. But unfortunately, his estate is currently the subject of a legal battle between his grand-daughter and ex-wife over control of his trust. 

In terms of other news stories, an 81 year old Republican senator was recently hospitalized after he tripped in a Washington hotel, and we&#39;re still learning about the effects of a train derailment in East Palestine. On top of that, there&#39;s some relevant insights from sociology on why poverty persists in America. 

I guess it&#39;s been quite eventful!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
