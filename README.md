<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is in the midst of a political battle. Democrats are trying to decide if they should try to save Speaker McCarthy from being ousted by Republicans. Meanwhile, Representative Matt Gaetz put forward a motion to remove him and there&#39;s a two-day showdown between the speaker and those on the hard-right of the Republican party. This knock-on effect has caused investors to become weary and markets to be more volatile. 

In other news, there&#39;s tension between the US and China over Chinese investments in small towns, and there&#39;s a brain drain from China with many people not heading to the US. Trump has been accused of civil fraud and he&#39;s facing a trial at the moment. 

The Nobel Prizes were announced this week and three scientists won for their work on electrons while others have won previously this week. Researchers are focusing on urban wildlife and their potential risks from disease - to people, pets, and animals themselves. In Germany, they&#39;re struggling to get support for their foreign policy plan which includes arming Ukraine as small towns are revolting against it. Lastly, young people in many states are dealing with legal battles over transgender care for minors as supporters argue it&#39;s safe.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
