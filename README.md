<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot of interesting and important developments are happening in the world right now! There is a crisis at OpenAI, a company focused on advancing artificial intelligence research, over the leadership of Sam Altman, and the European Union has just agreed on its first set of rules regulating use of AI. In the US, the Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked court-approved abortion while President Biden is openly criticizing his predecessor and former US President Donald Trump is creating fear among Europeans about abandoning NATO if he regains power. In Iraq, Iran-backed forces have taken over much of the country&#39;s farmland, and countries like the UAE are focusing more on sustainability as they seek ways to beat rising desert temperatures. On top of all that, companies are extending diversity programs to faith groups to fight mounting antisemitism. It&#39;s definitely an interesting time!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
