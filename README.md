<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot going on in the world. In the US, the Senate just voted to confirm Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. of the Air Force as the next chairman, despite a block put up by Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama. Attorney General Garland is refusing to give details on a Hunter Biden inquiry and turning awayRepublican efforts. Hunter Biden will be appearing in court next week on gun charges and Florida governor DeSantis slammed Biden&#39;s climate policy while two long-shot Republicans may miss the cut for the next GOP debate. 
In terms of technology, Google&#39;s chatbot Bard just got more powerful but it is still erratic and another chatbot called ChatGPT is able to generate images now. Internationally, President Biden finds himself caught between allies Canada and Indiawhile Canadian Sikhs and Hindus are further divided over Canada&#39;s accusation that Indian government is linked to a killing of a Sikh separatist. Ukrainian President Zelensky spoke to the UN security council about the correspondingly high barrier taking action due to five permanent veto-wielding members. And finally, there are Republicans inching closer to a spending deal that will likely spark a shutdown showdown with the Senate over deeper cuts proposed by Speaker McCarthy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
