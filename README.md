<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of upheaval in the world right now. In Ukraine, Russian forces are shelling border areas to tie up Ukrainian troops that might defend against attacks to the south. At the same time, President Biden has traveled secretively to Kyiv to demonstrate American resolve in the fight against Russian forces. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has been cracking down on citizens who criticize their government, handing out prison sentences of up to 45 years for their comments on social media. The US is also experiencing extreme weather from coast to coast as a large winter storm approaches and is predicted to disrupt travel and cause power outages. Lastly, closer to home, New York City has seen a surge in opioid-related deaths since the pandemic began and the four biggest cities in the US have banded together in order to confront rising violent crime and homelessness rates.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
