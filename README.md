<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is in the middle of multiple important elections happening around the country that could determine access to and regulations around abortion. People are feeling frustrated with the idea of a potential second Trump-Biden election and some voters are looking for alternative options. The Supreme Court looks likely to pass a law that would disarm domestic abusers, which could have far-reaching effects on gun rights. Meanwhile, thousands of people remain in Northern Gaza despite war closing in and Israel&#39;s bombing and ground invasion - they say going south is too dangerous. On the other hand, a combination of federal policies are succeeding in bringing solar energy manufacturing back to the US. Additionally, electric school buses are being used to store solar and wind energy for use during peaks in demand. Barbra Streisand released her memoir recently where she talks about the movies and men of her life. Lastly, former President Trump spoke at a Manhattan courtroom as he tried to preserve his business empire.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
