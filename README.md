<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of tensions in the world right now, particularly in the Middle East and in U.S. politics. In Israel and Gaza, the Pentagon has had to send officers to help with the challenges of fighting an urban war. Meanwhile, Republican infighting has led to a free-for-all for speaker of the House of Representatives. Here in the U.S., labor union members have gone on strike at a factory that makes one of Stellantis&#39; most profitable vehicles, raising concerns about inequality in American education. Elsewhere, California Governor Gavin Newsom is looking to shift his state&#39;s climate policies outwards into were far more carbon-saving efforts could be rolled out globally; while drug companies make billions from treatments for weight loss issues like Ozempic and Wegovy. Finally, a fight broke out over fake Donald Trump placards hung up in a wealthy town that lasted years, and there was an attempted murder by an off-duty pilot on an Alaska Airlines flight.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
