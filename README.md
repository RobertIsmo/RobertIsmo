<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, both parties are trying to work together quickly to avoid defaulting on debt payments. People who owe money on federal student loans have to start paying again soon after a deal was struck to raise the debt ceiling. In Russia, the border town of Bakhmut is becoming a kind of frontline in the current war between the Kremlin and Ukraine, with reports that at least 20,000 Russian troops have been killed in fighting for its control. Other news concerns the lasting damage caused by Covid-19 — particularly to people&#39;s lungs — and how U.S.-China relations are complicated as China tries to set the terms of their re-engagement. Elsewhere more lighthearted stories include a professor in Georgetown being roundly criticised for decorating a public sidewalk with 10-foot statues of Transformers characters, and research initiatives looking to discover how many LGBTQ+ Americans die by suicide each year.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
