<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a few big stories in the news. Financial markets and politicians in the United States are trying to figure out how to avoid hitting the debt ceiling, meaning the US government can&#39;t borrow any more money. In China, there&#39;s been a population decline for the first time in decades, with serious potential implications for their economy. In Ukraine, Russian strikes have made power outages part of going to school and teachers and students stay determined. Elon Musk is facing lawsuits in regards to Tesla&#39;s self-driving software overhype, while in a related British Museum and Greece conflict, talks over the Parthenon Marbles are happening in secret. Finally, diversity trainings may be quietly doing more harm than good.</p>

<h3>How Close Is the U.S. to Hitting the Debt Ceiling? How Bad Would That Be?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
