<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of international conflicts happening right now. The U.S. is being asked to take part in foreign conflicts, which many Americans feel weary about. There&#39;s also violence between Israelis and Palestinians, and there&#39;s evidence of rape and torture by Russian forces in Ukraine. In the U.S., Republicans are arguing about who should be the party&#39;s next speaker. Meanwhile, people are being forced to think carefully about how to handle money matters between friends. On the brighter side, a program that connects Muslims and Jews has brought them closer together despite the war. And soccer great Bobby Charlton recently died at 86.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
