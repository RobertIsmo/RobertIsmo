<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, Western-trained troops have stumbled in battle and medical posts close to the front lines are a critical lifeline for wounded soldiers. In New York, there is a state-wide reading crisis in schools and concern is growing that the government isn&#39;t doing enough. Meanwhile on a global scale, China&#39;s leader has reshuffled their nuclear force and the commander has been replaced. There&#39;s also been an influx of migrants to cities like New York and some are sleeping on the sidewalk due to lack of space in shelters. In Israel, there&#39;s a huge protest movement organized by particle physicist Shikma Bressler against a government decision. On the entertainment side of things, poet Mahogany L. Browne wrote a love letter to hip-hop on its 50th anniversary composed entirely of lyrics and Lizzo is being sued by three former dancers for creating a hostile work environment. There&#39;s also a new indictment against the former president Donald Trump put forward by Jack Smith which outlines multiple charges related to the 2020 election, sparking the conversation about what kind of trial America needs.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
