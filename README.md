<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p> 
There have been some tense relations between the U.S. and Israel recently over a judicial overhaul, with some disagreements between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Here in the U.S., Republicans are facing losses in their push to impose tighter voting laws on college campuses due to young people who mostly vote Democrat. In Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-wen is taking a risk by meeting with Speaker Kevin McCarthy as China opposes any exchanges. Meanwhile, Ukraine has had its steel industry helping with their war efforts while simultaneously providing body armor, helmets, and armored plates for vehicles. Mexico is contending with an overwhelming number of migrants stuck at the border due to the US&#39;s efforts to keep it secure. In a related story, dozens died in a fire at the same location resulting from this desperation of migrants. There was also a tragic shooting at a school in Nashville that left six dead prompting an investigation into the causes and emotional disorder of the shooter. A Connecticut woman has sued Vermont to take advantage of their medical aid in dying law because it&#39;s not allowed in Connecticut. Former Vice President Pence was ruled to have to testify in front of a grand jury about what happened on January 6th in Washington DC. And lastly, Donald Trump could potentially be indicted for hush-money investigations but specifics on timing remain unknown.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
