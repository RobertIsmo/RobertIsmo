<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot going on around the world right now. In Germany, the country&#39;s Defense Minister has resigned due to public criticism over her decisions. There is also ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine that resembles something from a bygone era. On the other side of the world, a water crisis in Arizona is causing hundreds of homes to go without water during a drought situation in the West. In other news, China recently implemented strict &quot;zero Covid&quot; controls which have created an unrest among workers who are unpaid. Meanwhile, Italy has finally arrested a notorious mafia boss who evaded capture for 30 years. Finally, there is also unrest in US theaters as some lawyers have been barred using facial recognition technology imposed by Madison Square Garden, but some have managed to return using an old law passed back in 1941. It&#39;s been a chaotic year for sure!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
