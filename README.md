<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot of big things are happening right now. In the US, the government is trying to come to an informal agreement with Iran in order to avert a nuclear crisis, former President Donald Trump is facing legal trouble and several of his aides and lawyers might be called as witnesses, and there&#39;s been a hearing held over Trump&#39;s arraignment. The Southern Baptists have also voted to expand restrictions on women serving as leaders. Meanwhile, in the UK, Boris Johnson has been accused of misleading Parliament over lockdown parties. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve is taking time to survey the effects of their rate changes while Germany just adopted its first national security plan. Lastly, Westfield gave up its San Francisco mall, signaling more pain ahead for retail and downtowns in the US.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
