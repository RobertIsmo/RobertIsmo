<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a few interesting things going on in the world. In Ukraine, U.S. officials are saying that their military forces have been spread too thin, and need to focus their efforts on a main counteroffensive in the south. Across the globe, August is ending with intense heat waves, wildfires, mudslides, and tropical storms - all being seen as warning signs of global warming. On the Texas border, there has been an effort to curb immigration - but now some of the local residents there aren&#39;t as supportive of it anymore. Finally, there&#39;s the upcoming Republican debate with 8 hopefuls at stake - but not Donald Trump - and it&#39;s almost time to find out who will be crowned winner of &#39;Top Chef&#39; this year.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
