<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of big events happening in the world right now. In Israel, lawmakers are set to vote on a new law that could limit the power of its Supreme Court. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently underwent emergency surgery for a heart defect. 

In the US, Florida governor Ron DeSantis is getting some criticism for his about-face on vaccines before the recent spike in Covid cases. The same is also true in San Francisco, where Mayor London Breed faces a tough re-election race due to residents&#39; frustrations with her pandemic response. 

Ukraine is still embroiled in conflict and violence that continues to affect its people. Elsewhere, South Koreans are making homes far away from home due to the pressure of modern life there. By contrast, Hollywood costume master Ann Roth has been killing it lately by making a number of iconic films look good. 

You can also check out the Tour de France (sort of), which was dominated by Jonas Vingegaard and his rival Tadej Pogacar. Finally, Spain votes on Sunday in what could be the first all-right coalition to enter government since the 1970s.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
