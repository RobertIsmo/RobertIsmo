<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now! The US is building a stretch of border wall and starting deportations to Venezuela, while there has been opposition from some Republicans on continued aid to Ukraine. In Ukraine, there was an explosion that killed at least 51 people, while Russian president Putin suggested a new narrative for a deadly plane crash. In the US, the Republican party is facing internal disagreements over their Speaker race, while former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy&#39;s hometown reflects on his fall. President Biden is watching all the political dysfunction from a distance and trying to contrast his own achievements with it. In other news, NFL hall of famer Dick Butkus passed away at 80, while former president Trump is facing charges tied to the 2020 election. Finally, Alabama was ordered to use a map with two districts that empower Black voters and may lead to the election of two Black representatives for the first time in the state&#39;s history.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
