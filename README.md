<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. Republican leaders in Nassau County are calling for George Santos, a congressional candidate, to resign because of lies on his resume. Hunter Biden is facing scrutiny over tax and gun charges, and Congress has begun investigations into the Biden administration. In Ukraine, power outages have people resorting to working in makeshift office spaces. California is experiencing rain relief for the first time in a while. In Miami, the Affordable Care Act&#39;s popularity persists. The FAA recently experienced an outage due to NOTAM alerts. And if Congress fails to increase the government’s borrowing limit on time, it could create serious issues with our economy and financial markets.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
