<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy week around the world. In Ukraine, there has been an escalation of attacks as military officials believe they have seen signs of a counteroffensive. In the US, Oklahoma recently approved the first religious charter school, and Mike Pence is challenging Donald Trump for 2024 presidential candidacy. Meanwhile in New Jersey, former governor Chris Christie is jumping into the Republican presidential primary. Robert Kennedy Jr., who is running for president with surprisingly high polling numbers, shared some right-wing ideas and misinformation. On the other side of things, Robert Hanssen from the FBI passed away after being sentenced to life in prison for espionage. Following this, former President Donald Trump asked a judge to stop E. Jean Carroll&#39;s second defamation suit against him regarding rape allegations. Additionally, Prince Harry in Britain is taking on the tabloids from his country that had been scrutinizing him for years. On another note, CNN&#39;s chief executive is trying to win back the trust of their network after recent events and in science news, new research claims that Homo naledi buried their dead in caves despite having tiny brains. Finally, Los Angeles will be commemorating a long-gone doughnut shop where there is now speculation surrounding an uprising that supposedly happened there in 1959.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
