<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In technology, universities are revamping how they teach due to the rise of the popular chatbot ChatGPT. Worldwide, there are similarities between current conflicts and wars from 70 years ago- like in Russia and Ukraine. In the US, some suburbs have had their water cut off due to drought, and Biden gave a muted address on Martin Luther King Jr. day. China is facing unrest due to unpaid Covid workers. California is girding for another round of rain and snow, and some real estate agents and brokers are disproportionately making much less than White peers. Europe has seen a decrease in inflation rates, but central bankers are still concerned about persistently high prices. There&#39;s a law passed back in 1941 that some lawyers have used to get back into Madison Square Garden despite facial recognition technology being used to them out. For Chinese New Year celebrations this year, someFestive festival dishes can be easily made at home. Lastly, people are discussing how power makes those in positions of authority act weirdly - from the royal family to Congress!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
