<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, Biden is calling on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, which seems unlikely. In Israel, there are civil unrest and work stoppages due to Prime Minister Netanyahu attempting to overhaul the judiciary, which he has recently delayed. The US has been pressuring Israel over this move and there have been major protests against it. In China, they are bailing out countries that are in debt instead of offering loans like the IMF would. A U.N. official has gone the Ukraine to visit a nuclear plant where there is potential for disaster due to their offensive. Esther Perel is podcasting-famous and trying to conquer new platforms while seeing patients. In the NCAA Men&#39;s Basketball Tournament final four, we have Connecticut, Florida Atlantic, San Diego State, and Miami representing each respectively. North Carolina expanded its Medicaid program after Republican opposition was defeated in their legislature. Rolling Fork, Miss., is still in need of assistance after being struck by a tornado recently. Finally in tech, there is a weeklong series on how to become an expert at A.I.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
