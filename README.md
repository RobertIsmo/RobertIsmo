<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, there&#39;s an ongoing debate about when educators should tell parents when students socially transition at school. Investigators from the Justice Department recently raided President Biden’s Wilmington home and seized documents near him. There were two major health-related bills passed before the new House arrived — one related to mental health funding and one related to drugs and pandemic preparedness. The annual Women&#39;s March is planned for this Sunday to focus on abortion rights. In Germany, there&#39;s an aversion to war due its history and politics. In Ukraine, there was a missile attack on an apartment complex which caused a lot of destruction. The US government has been amassing more debt in recent decades due to tax cuts, recession responses and bipartisan spending. 

On the sports side of things, the Giants had an unexpectedly successful season but ultimately lost against the Philadelphia Eagles in a playoff matchup. Meanwhile, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes sustained a leg injury but managed to make his way back in time to help his team win their game against Jacksonville.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
