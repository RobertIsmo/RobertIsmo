<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The news lately has been all about former President Trump and the Republican primary contenders. A recent survey found Trump with a huge lead across most regions, despite two indictments he is facing. People speculate as to why Trump is so hard to beat, and some believe he maintains a firm base of loyal supporters. Others like Ron DeSantis have been attacking his legal troubles in attempt to overtake him in the polls. Meanwhile, Nikki Haley is promoting a platform of &quot;nuts-and-bolts conservatism&quot; which included appeals to common sense and experience in the White House. 

Outside of the political sphere, there are also stories about homelessness in California, climate warnings from the Fertile Crescent, and judicial rulings against Trump on a few defamation suits. Moreover, an Austrian country is struggling to break away from Russian gas and a female trombonist is breaking barriers in classical music. It&#39;s certainly been an interesting few weeks!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
