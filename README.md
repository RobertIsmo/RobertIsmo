<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! In the US, there is a looming indictiment of former President Donald Trump and Republicans are deciding whether to protest it. In Europe, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are celebrating their partnership despite Russia&#39;s recent war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the UN has released a report showing that there is only 9 years left to stop catastrophic global warming unless people get together to make some big changes. Closer to home, a California bank has seen its stock prices plummet and France has been protesting French President Emmanuel Macron&#39;s government after they passed a law raising the retirement age. Finally, an ex-athlete has come forward and named a former coach as her abuser after discussing it for years.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
