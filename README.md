<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a really interesting time in the world right now. In Brazil, there is tension between President Jair Bolsonaro and the people who opposed him and were even trying to overthrow him earlier this week--the Supreme Court is now investigating him for how he may have inspired the attack. In Ukraine, Russian forces are looting valuable art pieces and attacking its cultural identity, while also targeting cities like Kyiv with missile and drone attacks. Meanwhile, in Germany the people of a small village have been cleared from their homes to make way for a coal mine expansion. Ecuador is struggling with debt and considering drilling more into its national rainforest, which would have an effect on the climate. Sweden has just announced it has found Europe&#39;s largest deposit of mineral resources that are used in green technology, like electric vehicles. And finally in Washington, D.C., the Justice Department recently installed a special counsel to investigate documents related to former President Donald Trump’s administration--a move he perceives as persecution. It&#39;s a lot going on at once!</p>

<h3>Hunting for Truffles Is a Perilous Pursuit, Especially for the Dogs Who Dig</h3>

<h3>Ecuador Tried to Curb Drilling and Protect the Amazon. The Opposite Happened.</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
