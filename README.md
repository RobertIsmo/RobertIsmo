<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are chaotic right now! There&#39;s a spending package being cleared by the US House to avert a shutdown, but there&#39;s a winter storm disrupting flights nationwide and it&#39;s causing problems with transport. It&#39;s even creating &#39;bomb cyclones&#39;-- storms that are more powerful than most. It looks like former President Donald J Trump is being blamed for the Capitol Riot in Washington with the release of a final report. On top of that, there&#39;s a race amongst publishers to be the first to market with their editions of the Jan. 6 report. The F.D.A has released something new too; morning after pills are not abortion pills, apparently. Over in Ukraine, their weapons wish list remains unfulfilled after Zelensky&#39;s trip to Washington and there have been some revelations about the Representative-elect George Santos not representing his campaign biography accurately. Meanwhile, in China, Covid cases are exploding, but their death toll stats aren&#39;t convincing anyone! In light of all this chaos, people trying to celebrate during the holiday season have to take extra precautions and get tested before attending events. Retirement accounts are also undergoing some changes in terms of transferring money from 529 plans to Roth I.R.As etc... So yeah - it&#39;s just complete chaos out here!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
