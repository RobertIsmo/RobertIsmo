<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there is a lot of unrest in the world right now. In occupied Ukraine, there&#39;s chaos and shortages amid Russian evacuation orders, forcing many civilians to remain. In the US, President Biden is facing a surge of migrants at the border, while the end of pandemic-era health orders could mean illegal crossings will increase. A mass shooting in Texas has sparked debate in the state consensus over raising age to buy assault weapons. In NYC, officials are searching for housing for migrants, and there&#39;s a rape trial surrounding President Trump. Meanwhile, Israel has conducted airstrikes in Gaza which have killed at least 13 people, and Phoenix is starting to clear a sprawling downtown homeless encampment.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
