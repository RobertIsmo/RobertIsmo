<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are really busy in the world right now! The Federal Reserve recently held interest rates steady and may still make an additional rate move by the end of the year, which could impact mortgages, credit cards, and other forms of debt. In politics, the Senate is poised to confirm military chiefs, but Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama has been blocking them over a Pentagon abortion policy. Meanwhile, President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu had a successful meeting this week to try to improve tensions between their countries, despite Biden expressing frustration with Netanyahu&#39;s government. There was also an international summit on climate ambition - the U.S. and China were not even invited to speak due to their poor record on hot air reduction. Attorney General Merrick Garland has said he won&#39;t be intimidated by threats from Trump allies about disclosure of information related to Hunter Biden&#39;s inquiries, and Speaker Kevin McCarthy is stuck doing a balancing act in order to push spending bills through the House without alienating right-wing members. On the international front, Ukraine has gained some ground against Russian forces but has still a long way to go in terms of making progress. Finally, Google&#39;s newest chatbot Bard is incorporating more features from Gmail accounts etc., while OpenAI released a new version of its &quot;ChatGPT&quot; chatbot that can generate images too. Former Texas Congressman Will Hurd just released an AI plan as the first from the Republican presidential field for 2021.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
