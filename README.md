<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there have been a lot of tensions in the Middle East. In Israel, the government is divided on whether or not it should invade Gaza in response to Hamas&#39;s attacks. The Democratic party in the US is also facing division as a coalition composed of young voters and people of color break with President Biden&#39;s stance on the situation. At the same time, there are other conflicts around the world, like in Sudan, where 19 million children are out of school due to war. In China, the death of former premier Li Keqiang has been met with public mourning and reflections on an era of greater growth and stability. Lastly, tech tycoon Elon Musk has become increasingly influential within social media platforms like Twitter.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
