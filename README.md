<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, the economy is in flux as the Federal Reserve signals possible rate cuts. This could affect everything from mortgages to government debt and have an effect on the stock market. The Supreme Court will decide an important case concerning abortion pill access and this could open the discussion of abortion laws around the country. In Texas, a recent ruling made it unclear which cases pass legal muster concerning abortion. Democrats are using this case to push for their agenda on abortion rights. 
Now, the Supreme Court will decide on obstructions charges in relation to Donald Trump following the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Israel&#39;s prime minister has also recently been in conflict with President Biden regarding war in Gaza, which could have implications domestically for him. 
At the United Nations climate conference, many nations agreed to transition away from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy sources. Oil companies showed support for this agreement as well. Lastly, a new study may be able to help treat severe morning sickness during pregnancy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
