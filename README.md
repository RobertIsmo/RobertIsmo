<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. AI companies are facing pressure to follow certain safety guidelines, and lawmakers are still figuring out how to regulate it. Former President Donald J. Trump is facing a trial set for May 2024 and his former fixer Michael Cohen has agreed to settle a lawsuit with the Trump Organization. Tony Bennett recently passed away at 96 but left behind his work as champion of the Great American Songbook. Across the globe, many countries are feeling the impact of extreme weather as wheat, sugar, and tomato supplies suffer in India. In Canada, this record-breaking wildfire season has led to an effort to move from suppressing fires to preventing them due to climate change. Closer to home, Texas A&amp;M&#39;s president had to resign after facing political backlash over appointing Kathleen McElroy as the lead for their journalism program.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
