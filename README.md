<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against a woman who sought court-approved abortion, and Ukrainian President Zelensky has arrived in Washington to seek out a new strategy after a failed counteroffensive, while Harvard&#39;s governing board nears a resolution on their President, Claudine Gay&#39;s future. Meanwhile Yale condemned the hanging of a Palestinian flag on a New Haven menorah and the special counsel has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump is immune from prosecution. 

In terms of technology news, Google lost an antitrust court battle with makers of Fortnite video game, and fighting continues to rage in Gaza as Israel issues warnings for another potential conflict. There has also been an increase in infectious diseases spreading across Gaza due to cold, wet weather conditions. Additionally, Houthi militia attacked a ship in the Red Sea according to the Pentagon and Africans are taking part in changing French by making jokes, rapping and writing books.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
