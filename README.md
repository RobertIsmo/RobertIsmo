<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a number of important news stories lately. In the US there are plans for a funeral honoring a 6-year-old boy who was killed in an alleged hate crime. In the world, families of hostages are dealing with deep feelings of hope and despair as tensions build in Gaza. Businesswise, the Chinese economy is hurting due to a long reliance on real estate and China is facing criticism for a big infrastructure project in Nepal which caused excessive debt. On the health front, scientists believe they may have found an explanation for the lingering symptoms of long Covid. In science news, fear about lab leaks has cast a chill over virology research. For dining, some great restaurants in New Orleans are being recognized as well as sustainable salmon farming initiatives. As for US politics, there&#39;s news around a settlement for families separated at the border by Trump. There&#39;s also Harvard University cozying up to mental health platforms like TikTok. And finally, about climate change, we&#39;re hearing about how building adaptations could reduce bird fatalities in NYC.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
