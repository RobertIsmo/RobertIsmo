<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening around the world right now. In Ukraine, a conflict is grinding on and negotiations to end it have become more tricky. Russian high school textbooks are trying to defend their role in the conflict. In the US, Senator McConnell released a letter declaring he is medically cleared after exhibiting small seizures in public. There is also an interesting story about a tech millionaire who is trying to build his own city from scratch. 

In South Africa, at least 74 people died in a horrific residential fire earlier this week and families are struggling to identify their relatives. Also, tourists were recently asked to stay away from Maui but some locals are now encouraging them to come back due to the plunge in tourism and related economic issues. Finally, Typhoon Saola hit Hong Kong today and another typhoon is predicted to hit China&#39;s east coast tomorrow.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
