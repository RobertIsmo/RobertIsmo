<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Republican Representative Kevin McCarthy is trying to become Speaker of the House, but he has been met with resistance from hard-right lawmakers. If his bid fails, alternative candidates could emerge. Brazilian authorities are reviving a fraud case against George Santos, and in Ukraine a deadly strike by US-made rockets has exposed Moscow&#39;s military failings. Here in the US, heavily armed individuals have caused fear and panic in public places, prompting discussion about gun control laws. Meanwhile, the US News &amp; World Report is changing its ranking system after boycotts from law schools. On the economy side of things, President Biden has passed laws to reshape the American economy with limited congressional majority and there has been an Islamic extremism suspect apprehended in Times Square. Lastly, Juan Tamariz is getting recognition for his work on close-up card magic and a look at how meals get delivered in the sky. People are starting to miss the good old days when culture wars were phony and greed was more accepted.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
