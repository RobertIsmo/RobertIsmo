<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. Donald Trump is facing legal issues, as Manhattan has indicted him and rumors of more charges to come. There&#39;s also a mayoral race between Democrats in Chicago which will decide their future, and a Supreme Court election in Wisconsin that could determine whether abortion will remain illegal in the state. On the sports front, UConn just won its fifth NCAA title with a decisive victory, while questions surrounding one of its all-stars have come up. In other news, China enacted a security measure concerning US chipmaker Micron Technology that could affect other foreign businesses around the world. Italy&#39;s Prime Minister has outlawed surrogacy for same-sex couples, leaving some babies without legal recognition, and there are reported instances of death and injustice on the southern US border between Mexico and Arizona. Finally, K-pop fans in South Korea are wondering if they are becoming irrelevant to the growing global demands of their beloved genre.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
