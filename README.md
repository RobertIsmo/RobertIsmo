<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, they have launched a ground invasion of Gaza after an air campaign that has killed thousands of Palestinians. Meanwhile in Lebanon, the militant group Hezbollah is agonizing over whether or not to join the fight with Israel. In response to Hamas&#39; attack on Israel, posters featuring kidnapped Israelis have been popping up across America, and being countered by anti-Israel protesters. There was also a mass shooting earlier this year in Maine that police had been warned about months before it occurred. Internationally, the Eurozone economy has shrunk and Japan&#39;s Central Bank has announced a move away from easy money policies. Closer to home, school districts are banning cellphones, leading to much controversy over the efficacy of such regulations. Lastly, King Charles is currently making his first royal visit to Kenya since colonialism, while in Chicago there is debate over if more immigrants should be allowed into the city amid a housing crisis.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
