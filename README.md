<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In India, they are trying to use technology to prevent collisions, but safety spending has shrunk. In Russia, schools are having students recite their ABC&#39;s and praise the country&#39;s army while demonizing the West. In Ukraine, there&#39;ve been explosions and the president is asking the citizens to show their appreciation to their soldiers. Outside of Russia, there is a sect called the Doukhobors whose pacifist beliefs are being challenged by war. Here in America, we just re-elected President Biden as our oldest leader and he’s asking voters to keep him in office until age 86. A death row prisoner in Missouri has some jurors second-guessing his sentence after they sentenced him to death. Also, in Brooklyn they tried an experimental program where residents responded to 911 calls instead of police officers and it could change law enforcement policies here. Lastly, many states have made their reputations even more recognizable by leaning into cultural issues this year. Oregon is having a political breakdown because Republicans are boycotting bills the Democrats proposed.  Lastly, at CNN Jeff Zucker was recently replaced by Chris Licht and he’s not too happy about that, while Meet the Press host Chuck Todd is leaving and being replaced by Kristen Welker.</p>

<h3>What Happened When a Brooklyn Neighborhood Policed Itself for Five Days</h3>

<p>On a two-block stretch of Brownsville in April, the police stepped aside and let residents respond to 911 calls.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
