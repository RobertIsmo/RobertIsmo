<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news happening around the world recently. In the Middle East, Hamas gunmen have launched a carefully planned military attack on Israel which reveals a deep understanding of its weaknesses. Tens of thousands of people in Gaza are displaced and struggling to find food, water, and shelter. However, Israel and Egypt have agreed to allow safe passage for Americans from Gaza. 

In the US, there is chaos surrounding the battle for Speaker of the House. Two Republican nominees have been announced this week but there are many Republicans refusing to back them so the House floor vote has been postponed until next week. Meanwhile, former President Trump is avoiding public debates and quietly working to twist delegate rules in his favor. 

Scientists have produced maps for an annular solar eclipse that will occur in October across much of the Western Hemisphere. Those interested in catching a glimpse should be sure to know when, where and how to watch it. 

California recently banned a red food dye over concerns that it might be a carcinogen which has put US Food and Drug Administration&#39;s policies in the spotlight. In New York City, an unlikely group of environmentalists are fighting to protect butterfly habitats by silencing lawn mowers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
