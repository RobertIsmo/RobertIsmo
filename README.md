<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of recent international news related to Israel and Gaza. Hamas launched an attack on Israel, which has now brought new scrutiny on the group&#39;s ties to Iran. Meanwhile, Palestinian Americans trapped in Gaza are feeling abandoned and wondering if the US government will step in to help them evacuate. There is the potential for military invasion in Gaza, which has caused divisions among the Jewish community in New York to be put on hold while they grieve together. Supporters have gathered near the El Al counter at Kennedy Airport to send supplies and encouragement to those heading to Israel. At the same time, there have also been airstrikes intensifying in Gaza and across the US, with revelations of Chinese bitcoin mines in Wyoming and their proximity to military data centers. Microsoft recently closed a $69 billion deal with Activision despite facing objections from regulators around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
