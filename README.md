<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of issues in the news that are impacting people around the world. In Ukraine, it&#39;s the second year of war between Russia and Ukraine and prospects of a stalemate are looming. Putin has admitted weakness in his country while committing to no limits in war spending. The United States has sent its most advanced ground-based missile defense system to Ukraine as tensions continue to rise. 

Meanwhile, back in the US, we are learning more about Donald Trump&#39;s tax returns after the IRS delayed auditing him while he was in office. It turns out he paid $1.1 million in federal income taxes in his first three years but paid nothing in 2020 as his income dropped. He also refused to disclose his taxes which led to an oversight battle from Democratic lawmakers since 2019. 

And weathered related news, much of the US is getting hit by a once-in-a-generation winter storm with strong winds, heavy snowfall and temperature drops. Travelers are being warned that their plans may be disrupted due to snow and rain. 

Additionally, there have been some interesting developments for small businesses with popular platforms such as Venmo and CashApp. There are new rules that require some users to report small transactions which is raising fear among small business owners. 

Finally, growing number of Covid deaths is causing people over 65 to skip vaccines boosters even though they had their initial vaccine shots. Unfortunately, the government isn&#39;t providing much support for these new shots.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
