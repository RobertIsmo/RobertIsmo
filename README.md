<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Republicans and Democrats are having some major standoffs, especially recently with Virginia races and control of government shifting and a potential government shutdown on the horizon. In the Middle East, Arab Nations are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza due to public anger, while Israel has pushed back hard against it. On the global front, the CDC is warning that congenital syphilis has become more than ten times as common in the past decade and nations that have vowed to halt global warming have been found to be expanding fossil fuel use despite it. There&#39;s also some interesting news in books right now, with one rising fantasy author bringing dragons, magic and steamy sex into her books. And finally, some opinion pieces are discussing if changes to 2008 debates have created more hostility between Presidential candidates and urging American Jews to act in response to October 8th massacre.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
