<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of worrisome things happening in the world right now. Russian President Vladimir Putin is hosting African leaders at a summit, while U.S. President Joe Biden is forcing the U.S. to share evidence of Russian war crimes with the Hague Court. The Federal Reserve has just raised interest rates for the first time in months, and many big consumer companies have also been raising prices, which could complicate the Fed&#39;s job. Tragically, Sinead O&#39;Connor, an evocative and outspoken singer, passed away at age 56. Mitch McConnell suffered an episode at the Capitol, and Rudy Giuliani admitted he made false statements about Georgia election workers. Melania Trump has mostly stayed out of public view while her husband fights to return to the White House, and people in the Midwest are dealing with intense heat combined with wildfire smoke from Canada. On top of all that, Greece&#39;s tourism industry is at risk due to climate change-fueled wildfires.</p>

<h3>Fed Raises Rates After a Pause and Leaves Door Open to More</h3>

<h3>Sinead O’Connor Remembers Things Differently</h3>

<p>The mainstream narrative is that a pop star ripped up a photo of the pope on “Saturday Night Live” and derailed her life.

<h3>Giuliani Concedes He Made False Statements About Georgia Election Workers</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
