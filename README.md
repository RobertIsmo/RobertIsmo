<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of worrying things are happening in the world. In the US, colleges are debating how to handle antisemitic attacks on student populations. At the same time, the war in Gaza is being documented and shared on Instagram by those trapped in the enclave. There were also videos emerging of fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters for control over Gaza&#39;s main stronghold. Additionally, there was a Republican debate just recently which revealed Nikki Haley’s hawkish vision and Ron DeSantis&#39; avoidance of risks during the debate.

On the business front, NewsNation has organized a G.O.P debate moderated by Megyn Kelly which could extend its relatively small viewership. An ongoing trial involving Ivanka Trump has provided insight on what she knows about financial fraud related documents and her personal style in court to match the cameras. 

In the technology realm, the future looks like it may be A.I based with a new device called Humane that aims to replace smartphones. This device would work with lasers to potentially cure us of our smartphone addiction-- though its success remains uncertain at this point. 

As far as something more lighthearted, an 88-year-old man has been performing old master&#39;s songs for his fellow exiles, evoking an Afghanistan that was left behind or one that could have been. In addition to this, there is an odd buildup of traffic jam causing items orbiting earth, which includes Elon Musk&#39;s satellites but also stuffed animals and tomatoes! Finally, there is a commercial plant In America that is attempting to pull carbon from the air for the first time ever in what could be significant progress in fighting climate change!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
