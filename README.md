<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world lately. In the US, former President Trump was just indicted for his involvement with sensitive information. The Supreme Court also recently ruled on a voting rights law which could mean changes to voting in many states. In Canada, they’re dealing with large and rare wildfires that have polluted the air. And in Belgium, they’re renovating their Palace of Justice in time for its 200th birthday. On the lighter side, NASA just found out their quarantine efforts after Apollo 11&#39;s Moon mission were mostly for show because they weren&#39;t actually protecting Earth from contamination by any organism brought back from the lunar surface.</p>

<h3>Inside Trump’s Club When the Call Came: You’re Indicted</h3>

<h3>Energy Drinks Are Surging. So Are Their Caffeine Levels.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
