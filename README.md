<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The news right now is pretty varied. In Israel, there was a massacre at a festival of peace and love that has changed the country dramatically. Meanwhile, Israeli military leaders are planning an invasion of Gaza City and targeting Hamas leadership. Further, US Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley is in the news for her diplomatic approach to Israel, while Joe Biden&#39;s campaign has raised millions of dollars more than Donald Trump&#39;s. There&#39;s also been a lot of discussion about a 15-year-old aspiring journalist being ejected from a Republican event, as well as a fertilizer shortage in Africa and parts of Asia causing desperate hunger. In the US, there is also news about Judge Tanya Chutkan trying the case related to the Capitol riot on January 6th, Madonna launching a career-spanning tour in London, megafires altering ecosystems around the globe, and a young father rebuilding his life before he was impacted by fires in Maui. Closer to home, there are some exciting activities going on in New York this weekend like Usher performing and a CrimeCon after someone&#39;s son was murdered.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
