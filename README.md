<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently there has been a lot of turmoil in the US when it comes to politics and social issues. Harvard&#39;s President, Claudine Gay, recently resigned due to plagiarism allegations and a backlash against antisemitism on campus. This sparked increased scrutiny of her academic record. Alan Garber is Harvard&#39;s Interim President. There have also been the recent Hamas attacks which have caused tension on campus and stirred up politics. 

Meanwhile, there has been some good news with inflation fading much faster than expected and border crossings between Mexico and Arizona set to reopen. Unfortunately, Joe Biden and House GOP members are currently in a heated debate about immigration policies. Finally, Joe Biden is giving two speeches to emphasize the contrasts of his policies compared to Trump&#39;s.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
