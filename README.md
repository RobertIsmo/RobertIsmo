<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a few major events going on globally. In the US, a powerful hurricane named Idalia is heading through the southeastern states, so people in Georgia and South Carolina have been warned about its potential for causing destruction and losses worth billions. At the same time, there is ongoing research into the Native American boarding school system, which sadly forcibly removed children from their families in an effort to assimilate them. Political news includes Trump&#39;s nomination potentially being decided before everyone knows if he&#39;s a felon, and there is evidence that some Republican women are using birth control legislation as a way to distract from their anti-abortion stances. On top of this, climate change has already caused serious damage to Canada, and its effects are now being seen in a storied river where lots of fish have died.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
