<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
As Social Security costs rise and lawmakers argue over what to do, the IRS is trying to push through an $80 billion overhaul. Meanwhile in Kabul, the former diplomatic-enclave is back to life as the Taliban settle in. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon is now the longest-serving first minister. In Michigan, a school shooting left 3 dead and 5 injured, and here in the US prosecutors are suggesting that Donald Trump&#39;s lawyer may have evidence of crimes. Lastly, Dianne Feinstein is stepping down after a long career leading San Francisco, flying the C.I.A. accountable for torture and much more.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
