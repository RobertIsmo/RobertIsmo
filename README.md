<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the United States is facing a possible default on its debt as soon as next month, so government officials are debating over whether the debt limit is constitutional. House Democrats have begun steps to force a debt-ceiling increase in order to avoid default, and there have been discussions regarding the 14th Amendment as it relates to the debt ceiling debate. On the business side of things, JPMorgan has been banking&#39;s regular rescuer, with the largest bank avoiding the stability questions that have impacted other banks. Markets have been trending downwards due to fears about banks and a weaker economic outlook, with some late shows also going dark due to a writers&#39; strike. There are also some interesting developments happening overseas—in Berlin, Germany, Russian spies have been discovered hiding in plain sight which has led to a Cold War-like chill; and in South Korea it has emerged that women were forced into prostitution for American soldiers during the Vietnam War. On the legal side of things, Justice Stevens&#39; private papers were made public providing a window into Supreme Court cases and decisions on abortion, presidential elections and more. Finally, there is an upcoming new type of hydropower called pumped storage which can access electricity from water&#39;s gravitational qualities rather than through traditional dams.</p>

<p>As the government heads toward a possible default on its debt as soon as next month, officials are entertaining a legal theory that previous administrations ruled out.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Vnl8S6"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
