<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Russia, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a tycoon and ally of Putin who built a paramilitary force to fight by Russia’s side, has been reported dead at the age of 62. Putin appears to be sending out the message that no degree of effectiveness can protect someone from punishment for disloyalty. 

Meanwhile, Donald Trump had to surrender at an Atlanta jail in Georgia for an election interference case. His mug shot was posted to X (which was formerly known as Twitter), his first criminal case in 2021. 

In Hawaii, the wildfires have caused insurance companies to reassess the state’s risk. This is due to Maui county blaming the utility for allowing the deadly fire to start which caused a lot of fatalities. President Biden was criticized for his “no comment” while some thought it came off callous towards the deaths. 

Finally, on a more positive note, there are dream jobs in the culture and art industries which involve long hours but are compensated handsomely. However, some executives have had their housing benefit reduced due to post-pandemic strains. Lastly, Jair Candor tracks elusive Amazon tribes only from the shadows in order to prove they exist so that their land can be legally protected.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
