<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some concerning developments around the world recently. In Palestine, the war between Hamas and Israel has led to little celebration in Bethlehem this Christmas season. To make matters worse, a senior defense official in Ukraine was accused of embezzling $40 million, and Russia has signaled an openness to a cease-fire in Ukraine. Here in the US, President Trump&#39;s legal issues are still making headlines - to the point that many have questioned his eligibility for office. Meanwhile, the slow rollout of a national charging system could hinder the adoption of electric vehicles that some say is badly needed. Last but not least, two paramedics in Colorado have been found guilty in the death of Elijah McClain from last year. Japan is also struggling with its trucking industry and trying to curb its punishing work hours which could disrupt its logistics system overall.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
