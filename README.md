<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
At this moment, tensions are high as Israeli and Hamas forces continue to clash and people around the world show support for those affected. In the U.S., Donald Trump continues to lead in several critical states while President Biden&#39;s multiracial base begins to fray. Additionally, a Times investigation revealed the toll U.S. artillery bombardment took against the Islamic State in terms of mental and physical health impairments on troops who fired them. On a lighter note, Nicolas Cage plays a man who pops up in people&#39;s dreams in his new dark comedy &#39;Dream Scenario&#39; and Mike Johnson is currently speaking of the House, corroborating evangelical beliefs and pushing priorities such as abortion and gay rights. Lastly, The New York Times has released their News Quiz for November 3rd, 2023.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
