<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is enduring a tumultuous time. In the US, there are political pressures on President Biden from Democrats who disagree with his embrace of Israel, as the civilian toll in Gaza continues to rise. In Israel, families of hostages are anxiously awaiting news while in Gaza citizens feel that an announced cease-fire won&#39;t bring an end to the war. Meanwhile, tensions in the world of artificial intelligence have been boiling over with Sam Altman suddenly being reinstated as OpenAI&#39;s chief executive. In the health sector, long-term care insurance is proving inadequate in providing financial security for older Americans. On a lighter note, in New York City preparations are underway for the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Finally, in light of all these events, one expert is urging us all to take time and be thankful for the contributions of those around us who help feed us.</p>

<h3>Why Long-Term Care Insurance Falls Short for So Many</h3>
<sub>By Jordan Rau and JoNel Aleccia</sub>
<p>The private insurance market has proved wildly inadequate in providing financial security for millions of older Americans, in part by underestimating how many policyholders would use their coverage.  <a href=""><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
