<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. A 21-year-old air national guard member was arrested for leaking secret documents. Documents are also showing there is infighting among Russian officials. The Florida Legislature has passed a six-week abortion ban, which is one of the most restrictive bans in the US. The Justice Department is looking to challenge an appeals court decision regarding access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Politically, people are discussing the 2024 presidential candidates and their positions on abortion. There was a tech consultant arrested for killing a Cash App Creator in San Francisco, and there is a historic defamation trial against Fox News that is underway. Also, the NY Attorney General is questioning Donald Trump in a lawsuit and Trump has threatened investigations of Democratic District Attorneys if reelected. People are paying high prices for old &quot;Rocky&quot; tapes out of nostalgia, and Dan Snyder has agreed to sell the Washington Commanders team for $6 billion amid investigations into sexual harassment claims and finances.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
