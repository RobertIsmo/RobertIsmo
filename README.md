<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some major events going on around the world. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been offering public assurances and has privately been preparing for an intensifying rivalry with the US. President Biden and Xi Jinping will be meeting soon amid ongoing trade tensions. Meanwhile, Xi has returned China to one-man rule by dismantling institutional barriers. Over 125,000 Israelis are being resettled due to border attacks and a nearby hospital is suspected of housing a Hamas complex. In Israel, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie criticized Trump for his rhetoric and lack of ambition in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. David Cameron, former Prime Minister of the UK, faces an uncertain record during this time of war. On the brighter side, there are signs of progress as Black women have been able to make strides in architecture and the US is experimenting with small nuclear reactors to hopefully solve a huge climate problem. Additionally, unfortunately, there is an even bigger drug crisis than opioids that people are becoming increasingly addicted to, making it difficult to treat.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
