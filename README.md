<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Gaza, war is widening the gap between the ruling authorities and citizens. There is also growing pressure in Bahrain for their recently established ties to Israel to be cut. In response, Biden has backed Israel’s right to defend itself since the Hamas terrorist attack, but his team has increased pressure to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza. Recently, some educators in Oakland have planned an unauthorized teach-in supporting Palestinians which has raised concern from certain Jewish groups. On top of this, there are also political frictions unsettingling Ukraine as it seeks aid from Washington and a global race to tackle AI’s harms. Additionally, legislation to send military aid to Ukraine and Israel is on the brink of collapse with a test vote slated in the Senate soon. Meanwhile, Styles Magazine has featured its 71 most stylish “people” of 2023 and there are allegations that a private police training company encouraged unconstitutional tactics in New Jersey.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
