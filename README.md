<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of tension happening in the world right now including the conflict in Ukraine where Russia is reportedly mounting fierce offensive operations, Israel&#39;s High Court taking on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s push for judicial overhaul and President Donald J. Trump facing a potential third indictment. In the U.S., some Republicans are running attack ads trying to persuade G.O.P voters that Trump cannot win another general election while the Biden administration is facing a legal pushback on its new asylum policy from the federal government. Another issue domestically is George Santos using his candidacy and ties to Republican donors to create moneymaking schemes. To top it all off, the Midwest is currently dealing with a heatwave and a lingering wildfire smoke.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
