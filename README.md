<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got some news to share about what&#39;s going on in the world. 
In Business, there are negotiations and walkouts at Ford Company due to union demands. 
In NYC, Senator Robert Menendez was recently indicted for bribery, and there could be other key players involved in the case. Additionally, China&#39;s shadow banks are facing financial crises and U.S. and China just agreed to a new economic dialogue format to try to resolve differences. 
On the global front, there have been budget drones being used in wars and South Korea has made fares free for senior subway riders. Also, President Biden is warning that Trump could ‘destroy’ democracy and plans on taking him down in the upcoming election season. It has also been discovered that an NYC daycare was utilizing a secret door to keep hidden narcotics in the location where a child died. Lastly, Governor Jim McGreevey, who resigned following an extramarital affair is considering running for mayor again as part of a potential political comeback.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
