<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of turmoil in Sudan after they overthrew a dictator in 2019. Clashes spread across the country as rival factions of the military battle for control. Another place stuck in a violent conflict is Ukraine, which is in desperate need of weapons and munitions. Meanwhile, China has yet to call the president of Ukraine due to the war that Russia has started. On the lighter side, news from Silicon Valley shows that playing fast and loose with the truth comes with consequences, and donations for Donald Trump surged after he got indicted. Lastly, April 15th marks the 10-year anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing, a reminder of how special their finish line has remained.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
