<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the global economy is facing another period of significant risk, with a potential for wider conflict escalating in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas. In areas affected by airstrikes, such as Gaza, there&#39;s been a lot of death and despair as a result. Protests have broken out over this conflict and have been seen as part of an ideological battle for certain parts of America&#39;s college campuses. The controversial basketball coach Bobby Knight recently passed away at the age of 83, after leading Indiana University to national success while having some reported incidents of rage towards players and referees. In the U.S., Congress attempted to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib after her criticism of Israel but was blocked by House members. Also in the U.S., there was a push to kick one New York congressman out office after allegations surfaced but unfortunately failed due to lack of support from some members on both sides of the aisle. Additionally, former President Trump has had a few legal issues recently in terms of First Amendment challenges and delays regarding his document trial, along with Donald Trump Jr.&#39;s testimony in a fraud case against him. To top geopolitical news off, China’s male leaders have tried to reenforce gender roles by pushing women back home at a time when they also face an ongoing demographic crisis and slowing economy. It’s no surprise that the Federal Reserve recently held their rates steady and expressed willingness to raise them again in the future if needed.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
