<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In terms of the world, it seems like different nations are communicating with each other a lot. The US and China are restarting climate negotiations while the US is sending cluster munitions to Ukraine in an effort to fight the Russian presence. Meanwhile, the Dutch government is collapsing over its attempt to restrict immigration into the country. On a lighter note, there&#39;s an inspiring story about a French Open champion who was able to make a comeback after nearly giving up tennis, and on the Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is proving to be a force not to be reckoned with! Finally There&#39;s been some controversial activity as former president Donald Trump asked about having the IRS investigate two FBI officials and discussions are arising about whether or not an infamous crime scene should be demolished before trial.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
