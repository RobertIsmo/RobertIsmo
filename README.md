<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of political a shakeups going on around the world. In the US, Joe Biden is facing challenges from those who think that providing aid to Ukraine is too costly. Meanwhile in Finland, they are on the cusp of joining NATO, but possibly without Sweden due to Turkish hold up on their application. There’s also a Supreme Court case challenging President Biden’s authority and Congress setting up a veto fight. In Chicago, two Democrats running for mayor were having debates over crime and policing which Republicans are keeping an eye towards 2024. The police superintendent retired after the Mayor&#39;s defeat and in India digital payments, even for chai, are impressive and growing. Finally, in Northern Ireland Unionists are trying to figure out if they should accept a new trade deal which could help facilitate trade post-Brexit but could also destroy government efforts to restart.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
