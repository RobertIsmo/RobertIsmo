<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are several issues happening in the world right now.  The Biden administration is trying to impose water rationing for states that get their water from the shrinking Colorado River. In California, tech layoffs and studio cutbacks have put their economy on edge and caused a deficit instead of the previous $100 billion surplus. South Korea is experiencing outrage after leaked documents revealed US spying on allies. Egypt is accused of a plan to secretly produce weapons for Russia. In the US, there was a shooting in Louisville where the gunman bought his rifle legally, with bodycam video set to be released soon. There&#39;s also news from Ukraine about how their power grid has endured Russian bombings in attempts to break their will. President Biden recently spoke with Evan Gershkovich’s family. There&#39;s also an interesting article about consultants that are trying to get people back into the office, though not too successfully. Regarding abortion, it was revealed that there is a second drug that can be used on its own for medication abortion without FDA approval. Lastly, Chicago was chosen as the location of the 2024 Democratic Convention, reportedly embodying its liberal values.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
