<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world these days! A Justice Department investigation is looking into how former Presidents Trump and Biden acquired classified documents after leaving office. In business, the latest inflation report revealed rent prices remain rapid, despite car prices falling. Additionally, there is a current egg supply shortage in some parts of the country due to an avian flu outbreak and increasing production costs. On the political front, a review of records uncovered suspicious fundraising efforts for George Santos&#39; congressional run, as well as many lies that were found in his résumé when he ran for Congress.  On the brighter side, people are eager to travel and explore yet again, but there&#39;s U.S. scrutiny of police outposts by China around the globe. Closer to home, a &quot;Geezer Happy Hour&quot; has become incredibly popular with those over 65 years old enjoying the music like it was decades before. Finally, there have been fraud allegations against a crypto currency mogul and Sam Bankman-Fried responded that customers can still get their deposits back. As far as music goes, Jeff Beck passed away this week and there are plenty of essential songs showcasing his range and intensity released from 1966 to 2010 that have made him a legend.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
