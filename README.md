<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a bunch of political issues happening in the US. The Republican party has proposed cutting federal spending to lift the nation&#39;s borrowing cap, and Disney is suing Florida governor Ron DeSantis over control of its resort after he criticized an education law. Also in the US, Montana legislators voted to bar a transgender lawmaker from the House chamber, and there&#39;s been speculation about Russian President Putin&#39;s health. In India, there&#39;s a new cricket league that is offering girls opportunities they never had before. Meanwhile, China and Ukraine had a phone call with carefully chosen words, and there could be new rules for power plants to encourage carbon capture. The US also agreed to cooperate with South Korea on nuclear weapons this week, and in New York state, there is skepticism over Governor Hochul&#39;s advisor since he lives in Colorado. Lastly, polls indicate that voter opinions on President Biden&#39;s age may be misguiding.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
