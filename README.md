<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. China has been using balloons to spy on military sites all around the world, which the US is monitoring closely. In Syria, a hospital is filled with tragedy caused by a huge earthquake. There&#39;s also conflict in Ukraine where police are using drones to protect citizens from ongoing bombardments. In the US, President Biden is campaigning in Florida against proposed cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security, and alongside him some Republican representatives have been using coarse tactics like heckling during his State of the Union address. Meanwhile, Abortion Rights Supporters are speaking out about their views and free speech versus disinformation is coming to a head in a federal court case. Lastly, there&#39;s discussion around how China can reverse its population decline, taking cues from Sweden which has been trying to boost its birthrates for years with varying results.</p>

<h3>China Sends Spy Balloons Over Military Sites Worldwide, U.S. Officials Say</h3>

<h3>Heckling of Biden Reflects a New, Coarser Normal for House G.O.P.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
