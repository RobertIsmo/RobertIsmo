<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, the US is largely dealing with economic concerns. The president addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Friday evening after congressional passage of legislation to prevent economic calamity. However, negotiations suggest that debt will keep growing and fast.

On the world stage, there has been a tragic train crash in India, with more than 230 dead and 900 injured. The US Secretary of State gave a speech in Finland (NATO&#39;s newest member) talking about Russia&#39;s failures. Meanwhile, people are struggling to figure out who is to blame for two women and a child dying in a shelter in Ukraine&#39;s capital city, while Russia is evacuating its border towns.

Back closer to home, prosecutors have issued a subpoena for a description of military options for Iran which Trump discussed in an interview but his legal team can&#39;t find any such document. Additionally, Atlanta prosecutors contacted firms that were hired by the Trump Campaign to investigate voter fraud but they reported there was no evidence of significant fraud occurring.

In a seemingly unrelated event, three companies are settling lawsuits related to public water contamination by &#39;forever chemicals&#39; and at Churchill Downs two investigations are underway - one into why twelve thoroughbreds died at the track recently and another into whether the U.S. can bring China into arms control talks amid increased tension between Moscow and Washington DC.

Finally, one man is trying to make running more inclusive across communities through his new book with Martinus Evans lacing up and becoming this year&#39;s National Champion spelling bee winner - all within 45 seconds!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
