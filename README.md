<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on right now! In the US, House Republicans just elected Mike Johnson as speaker, a hard-right conservative. His election is a signal that Republicans in Congress are going to push a conservative agenda. There&#39;s also the ongoing fight between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which has been accompanied by powerful images from photojournalists offering context into the lives of those affected by the conflict. On the domestic front, US workers and the United Auto Workers Union have reached a tentative contract agreement with Ford, while former President Trump is facing legal troubles as federal prosecutors try to reinstate a gag order against him after he made prejudicial attacks on court personnel. Finally, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas&#39; loan was recently forgiven, raising ethical and possible tax issues.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
