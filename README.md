<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now that is impacting many people around the world. First, in China President Xi Jinping is revealing very little about his personal life. Also, New York Times journalists traveled to Northern Gaza and saw a war-torn landscape filled with destruction and darkness. In Israel, The military has reported finding a tunnel shaft at Al-Shifa Hospital but it is unclear if Hamas had been using it or not. They also are investigating multiple universities for antisemitism and Islamophobia complaints. In the technology space, OpenAI pushed out Sam Altman as C.E.O. and replaced him with Mira Murati who previously served as its chief technology officer. On social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), advertisers are pulling their campaigns after Elon Musk&#39;s endorsement of an antisemitic post caused outrage. And in journalism, sideline reporters are dealing with repercussions after Charissa Thompson admitted she made up reports during N.F.L games on Fox. Finally, before he was elected speaker of the House, Mike Johnson expressed his views on L.G.B.T.Q youth during a prayer call which brought up negative commentary from some circles.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
