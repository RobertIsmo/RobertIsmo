<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy news week, with a lot of interesting developments. Donald Trump is facing criminal charges in Manhattan and he&#39;s attacking the judge overseeing the case. World leaders are not surprised, as they feel confident in his political resilience. Another story to watch is a merger between Digital World and Trump Media, which has been held up by investigations but is rushing to complete the deal. In Finland, the country recently ranked as the happiest on earth for six consecutive years, people are more complex than their reputation would have us believe. In Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced Moscow&#39;s presidency of the Security Council meetings after a deadly attack in a Ukrainian town. And there have been updates to other stories - journalist Evan Gershkovich, detained by Russia for reporting, was a storyteller who felt connected to the country; Paul Vallas and Brandon Johnson face off for the Chicago Mayor position; there has been talk all over America about abortion rights; and finally, UConn has made it all the way to the women&#39;s basketball championship game against San Diego State, looking to make it five championships in twenty-five years.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
