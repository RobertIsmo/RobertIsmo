<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of turbulence in many parts of the world. In Morocco, there has been an earthquake that caused damage in cities and towns in the South. Ukraine remains in conflict, with ongoing fighting along a 1,000-mile front. There are also some tensions in the US, including government opposition to aid for Ukraine and antitrust cases against tech giants like Google. In the UK, over 100 schools have had to close due to dangerous lightweight concrete. And President Biden recently visited Asia with a diplomatic to-do list.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
