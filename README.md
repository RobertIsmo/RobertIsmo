<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now - it can be hard to keep up. In US news, there&#39;s an indictment around Donald Trump&#39;s handling of government documents, and activists are gathering outside the courthouse. Business news includes stories about inflation, stocks climbing into a bull market, car prices easing, and revenge spending pushing prices higher. On the world news front, there&#39;s an update on the situation at Ukraine&#39;s eastern border, Indian women abandoned by husbands working overseas, and more. In health news, there are doctors turning to chatbots to communicate with patients. Finally, for anyone in New York this summer dining recommendations and for US readers an update on the House votes after a blockade by hard right Republicans. Plus, it has been record hot this June - suggesting extreme weather is in our summer future.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
