<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, a prosecutor has been elevated to special counsel to investigate possible wrongdoing surrounding former President Trump&#39;s election-related activities, while Trump himself is dealing with legal bills from ongoing cases that are affecting his financial situation. In the tech industry, one of the biggest names has been arrested and awaits trial for charges stemming from his cryptocurrency business. On the climate front, conservation efforts to protect endangered birds are being made across Hawaii. And China&#39;s stalling economy is worrying nations around the world as President Biden has warned of it being a time bomb. Lastly, Fox News is dealing with significant fall out from its handling of a defamation case brought by Dominion Voting Systems which resulted in a large settlement.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
