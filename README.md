<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the U.S., mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2002, making it more difficult for people to afford a home as supply is short. Wildfires in Hawaii have exposed the state&#39;s lack of defenses against climate shocks, and now officials are trying to figure out how to respond to the disaster. In Georgia, Trump Grand Jurors have been threatened, while a reporter uncovered some Trump-related news after months of waiting. A majority of Americans think the charges against him have merit. There&#39;s also a debate taking place over how Governor DeSantis is handling his election campaign. Meanwhile, Republicans are taking a closer look at the 6 kinds of GOP voters in an effort to make changes for 2024. Lastly, there&#39;s been an Instagram account that caused an uproar in California after racist posts were made public. Scientists are still trying to understand how new weight-loss drugs work. Finally, Colorado&#39;s mountain towns have been attracting remote workers, creating tension between those already there and the influx of affluent people looking for affordable housing.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
