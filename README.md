<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It appears that the world is in a state of turmoil as a number of different events are happening around the world. In Russia, a group of mothers managed to recover their children from Russian authorities by making a nerve-wracking 3,000-mile journey. In Canada, a pro-Russian hacking group may have targeted their infrastructure. In Ukraine, there is a stalemate taking place between Russian forces and Ukraine&#39;s forces. In the United States, Stanford Law has taken a stand for free speech but it is proving difficult to protect. There are also economic issues like Uber Eats and DoorDash, who delivery drivers have been praised as pandemic heroes but it is now becoming increasingly harder for them to make a living. There are also Trump and his lawyers who have been quickly hired after TV appearances or brief phone calls by him and there are money issues for those aged retirement. Finally, El Salvador has declared a state of emergency in order to decimate their ruthless gangster groups but at what cost?</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
