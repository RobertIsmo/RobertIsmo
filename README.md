<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, a former president, Donald Trump, is facing prosecution, which has caused political uproar and seen Republicans rush to defend him. Meanwhile, Democrats are feeling both joy and anxiety due to this consequential moment. Elsewhere, a strange odyssey through Russian prisons has begun for Ukrainian convicts and Putin&#39;s allies are facing legal disputes as an international criminal court steps in. Technology-wise, people have been falsely accused of crimes because of faulty facial recognition technology and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is expressing optimism and worry over the state of the AI race. California is also introducing electric truck limits to try and reduce carbon dioxide emissions while Biden&#39;s new rules will make electric cars ineligible for certain tax credits. Lastly, Nashville is currently grieving after a school shooting and desperately trying to find common ground between opposing sides.</p>

<h3>Republicans Erupt in Outrage and Rush to Defend the Defendant</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
