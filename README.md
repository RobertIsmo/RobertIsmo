<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of unrest happening around the world right now. In Israel, the government has set out to vanquish Hamas and take control of Gaza, but this task comes with many challenges. Meanwhile in the US, Pentagon officers have been called in to help Israelis fight an urban war. The house Republicans are having their own issues with forming a unified party and can&#39;t seem to come together. There is also a mother and daughter from Central America waiting to get into the US legally after obeying President Biden&#39;s warnings about coming to the country illegally. In Ukraine, young adults have been particularly hard hit by the war while in China there have been some shakeups among their military officials. Economists have had difficulty correctly predicting inflation and consumer and labor market factors over the past three years. Michael Cohen is giving testimony against Donald Trump in court while two members of Trump&#39;s legal team for the 2020 election recently pleaded guilty to cooperate with prosecutors. Lastly, Poland Spring has been involved in a hidden attack on water regulation rules that they don&#39;t agree with in Maine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
