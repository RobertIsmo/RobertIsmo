<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening in the world right now. In Israel, Israeli forces are close to a major hospital in Gaza that they think is covering a Hamas complex. There have been over 100,000 marches in France against antisemitism due to tensions surrounding the Gaza conflict. In the US, Christie has blamed Trump for a lack of ambition on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and also for rhetoric of intolerance. Additionally, Tim Scott has suspended his presidential campaign because his message wasn&#39;t resonating. The US also carried out airstrikes on targets that it believes are linked to Iran. There&#39;s been tragedy in Alabama as the mayor committed suicide beneath certain circumstances. In Myanmar, a National Unity Government is fighting for recognition as they were formed as an alternative to the junta resulting from their 2021 coup. The FBI is examining whether Eric Adams cleared red tape for the Turkish government after he won the 2021 Democratic mayoral primary in NYC. In Hawaii, there was an intense fire and multiple failures contributed to people being trapped during the difficult journey ahead of them. In medical news, there&#39;s been a new gene editing treatment that cuts dangerous cholesterol in small studies so far. Lastly, shrimpers in Texas are struggling with the decline of their industry and having to consider other options as a result.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
