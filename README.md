<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy news week! A lot is happening around the world. The Biden administration is flexing the power of the federal government in their Semiconductor plan and are asking the chip industry to make promises about its workers and finances in return for vast subsidies. In the U.K. and E.U., their relationship has improved as they struck a Northern Ireland trade deal to heal a Brexit wound, which had risked a trade war between London and Washington. Additionally, Biden has deployed high-powered aides and more aid to bolster Ukraine in their battle with Russia. 

In the US, Biden has plans to crackdown on migrant child labor following a Times investigation which showed children were working in dangerous jobs throughout the country. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing challenges to student loan cancellation and whether or not it falls within Biden&#39;s authority, as well as seeming doubtful over the broad sweep of identity theft law. 

For science fans, there&#39;s an article about ethical ways to kill rats, with interesting ethical questions about whether people should be asking these questions at all. Lastly for weather watchers, snow and sleet are expected in parts of the Northeast this week, so you can check out our article on just how much snow is likely to fall where you live!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
