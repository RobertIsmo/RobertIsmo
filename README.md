<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of chaotic news happening around the world right now. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken held a meeting with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to discuss a surge in migration at the U.S.-Mexico border, with thousands of migrants arriving every day. In Israel, officials have warned that diplomacy with Lebanon is running out as rockets from Iranian-backed Hezbollah forces keep streaming in. Additionally, images of watermelons are being used to signal support for Palestinians due to fighting between Israel and Hamas, and there have been pro-Palestinian protests blocking traffic outside of airports in New York and LA. Other political news includes the Michigan Supreme Court&#39;s decision to let Trump stay on the ballot, and the Colorado Republican Party asking for him to stay on the ballot, too. Trump has been increasingly using social media to make scathing attacks, while companies like MSNBC, NPR, Vox Media, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution have started true crime podcasts about him. Lastly, The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft for using its articles to train chatbots that compete with it.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
