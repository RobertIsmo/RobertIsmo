<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a massive population shift around the world that will change the shape of our world and its most powerful countries. In Ukraine, there is still a deep battle with Russian land mines which stall their counteroffensive. There have been 11th-hour talks to help stabilize global grain prices to avert famines. In Gilgo Beach, an arrest bears out a decade-old prediction of the killer&#39;s characteristics. There is also a case against Rex Heuermann for the Gilgo Beach killings. Britain&#39;s health service is in the deepest crisis of its history, while President Biden has yet to gain much support from small donors. Former President Trump appears to have more traction with polls. Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon singles title and left Novak Djokovic with his first final&#39;s loss at the All England Club in a decade. Designers are seeking disaster-proof homes that can better protect against extreme weather due to climate shocks, while New York City subway riders are stuck in hot cars due to poor air conditioning in some cars. Finally, Detroit is stepping up code enforcement and sprucing up parks after filing for bankruptcy 10 years ago, although the changes bring risks as well.</p>

<h3>Small, Hidden and Deadly: Mines Stymie Ukraine’s Counteroffensive</h3>

<h3>Black Sea Grain Deal Hangs on 11th-Hour Talks, Again</h3>

<h3>In Gilgo Beach Killings, an Arrest Bears Out a Decade-Old Prediction</h3>

<p>In 2011, experts made a list of characteristics they predicted the suspect would have. The man charged in three of the killings checks many of those boxes.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3rwFIEV"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>The Case Against Rex Heuermann: Read the Document</h3>
<sub></sub>
<p>Suffolk County, N.Y., prosecutors argued against bail for Mr. Heuermann in a 32-page document that explicitly details the investigation into the Gilgo Beach killings. The New York Times has redacted phone numbers, email addresses, personal addresses and the names of private social media accounts. It has also redacted offensive material that was included in Mr. Heuermann’s internet searches.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3PVn8Ak"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Biden, With Sluggish Small Donations, Waits for Liberal Energy to Rise</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
