<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news lately about the economy, climate, politics, international relations, and culture. The US jobs report hints at an economic slowdown President Biden will need to navigate. Scientists are looking into ways to reduce emissions through electric vehicles to tackle climate change. Journalists have been placed in difficult positions as they work to report on laws imposed by Vladimir Putin in Russia. Justice Thomas was recently advised he didn&#39;t have to report expensive gifts.  In New York City, there is an identity crisis occurring around a popular Chinese restaurant. Trump is using criminal cases and political pressure to rally support for his campaign while hiring an anti-Muslim activist. Israel recently retaliated against Lebanon after a tense incident at their border and workers are trying to unravel the mysteries of global supply chains with advancements in A.I. and DNA technology. Meanwhile, in spite of international differences on how to handle China, US and Europe leaders still find some common ground. Concerts are finally available again for an unfortunately high cost with complicated registration procedures and scalpers trying to take advantage of fans. And finally, San Francisco is facing concerns about its lawless status after the stabbing death of a tech leader.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
