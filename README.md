<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the tech industry, the Biden administration is looking into how it could take action against Chinese cloud computing companies like Alibaba and Huawei. In the justice system, Supreme Court Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote an opinion essay in The Wall Street Journal defending his private jet travel to a luxury fishing trip after a ProPublica article came out about it. In science, a reporter recounts his dive in Alvin, a three-person submersible, and the dangers behind that adventure. In the fight against opioid crisis, there is debate going on over new Fentanyl laws and whether it will be helpful of not. People also remember how Pink Floyd&#39;s music was synched with &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; movie decades ago by a Times reporter. Rent rises could affect two million renters in New York and Ukraine just announced its counteroffensive battle against Russia with leaders trying to bolster morale and Western support. NBA players are training in boot camp to become broadcasters and commentators, and an insurrectionist Daniel Rodriguez who assaulted an officer during Jan 6th riot has been sentenced to more than 12 years of jail time. Lastly, Oklahoma is fighting extreme heat in addition to storm damage they have already endured with many people being without power.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
