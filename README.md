<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! The U.S. is scrambling to stop Iran from providing drones for Russia as the war in Ukraine continues. Meanwhile, doctors are trying to stop the spread of misinformation about Covid-19. Southwest has had a major meltdown recently and caused thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed. There&#39;s also a dangerous &#39;atmospheric river&#39; storm hitting the West Coast, and a Supreme Court ruling meaning that certain migrants must stay outside of the U.S. In terms of business, companies are trying to work out what to do with all their vacant office spaces - whether it be storage, making them into gyms or film sets. On top of this, there&#39;s an ugly fight within the Republican party as they select their new leader. To make matters worse, some of the party leadership are staying silent over George Santos&#39;s false statements. Finally, Google employees are anxiously bracing themselves ahead of cost-cutting plans.</p>

<h3>Migrant Expulsion Policy Must Stay in Place for Now, Supreme Court Says</h3>
<sub>By Adam Liptak, Miriam Jordan and Eileen Sullivan</sub>
<p>The temporary stay in lifting the pandemic rule known as Title 42 is a provisional victory for 19 states, led mostly by Republicans, that had sought to keep it in place on the border.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3GlZkQO"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>What Would It Take to Turn More Offices Into Housing?</h3>

<p>Vast amounts of empty real estate are a crisis for building owners.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
