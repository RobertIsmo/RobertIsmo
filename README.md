<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of political developments lately, especially in the US. President Trump is facing a criminal indictment and Fox News is facing a civil trial, both back-to-back. Leaders around the world don&#39;t seem affected by this news and believe that Trump would be politically resilient. Also, other news includes a salacious indictment against Trump which is the latest chapter in his life that was made for the tabloids. Across the world, Venice is being saved but woe to it because there are repercussions to such change.

In sports, UConn has made it to the final with a romping win over Miami, and San Diego State made it with an exciting buzzer-beater from Lamont Butler. The Iowa game was a big hit for ESPN with 5.5 million views and now there&#39;s a University National Championship final on network TV coming up!

Finally there have been natural disasters like Tornadoes which have ripped wide trails of destruction across multiple states recently killing 23 people and injuring many more. In Ukraine, China has been looking at Russia&#39;s losses and it has lessons to offer in terms of supply lines and nuclear threats in case of any conflict. Zelensky denounced Russia getting U.N Security Council Presidency as complete bankruptcy of such institutions while they are also trying out playing cards with pictures of NATO weapons systems to help soldiers quickly distinguish friend from foe. The FBI is also investigating activities of Proud Boys  and scrambling after evidence while trying to cope with their obsolete technology.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
