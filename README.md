<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now the world is experiencing a lot of conflict and unrest. In the Middle East, there has been a resurgence of violence between Israelis and Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. In the US, the state of Florida is grappling with an influx of non-native Burmese pythons while opposition to abortion rights and homosexuality is being championed by a wife of one of the new Speakers. In Ukraine, tensions have heightened between Russia and its navy that are trying to block Odessa. Africa as a continent is seeing its population growing faster than anywhere else and this has begun registering around the world. Climate change has also gotten to Italy, making it harder to find white truffles that can be very expensive when you get them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
