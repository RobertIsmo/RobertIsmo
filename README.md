<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like lots of interesting things are going on in the world right now. In the US, North Carolina has seen a rise in abortion visits since Roe vs. Wade was overturned and Walgreens announced that it won&#39;t offer the abortion pill in some conservative states.

In international news, Ukraine is engaged in a battle with Russia over roads that lead to the eastern city of Bakhmut, while China&#39;s tactics at diplomatic talks are resulting in increased tensions around the globe.

Closer to home, business owners are struggling to keep afloat as consumers turn to premium items and inflation squeezes lower-income shoppers. In California, heavy snowfall has left people rationing food and stranded for days. Meanwhile, an old legal quirk poses an urgent problem for wildlife as officials lack authority over insect populations facing decline. Finally, protests have erupted over another police training center near Atlanta and Pamela Smart—recipient of the movie To Die For—is petitioning for mercy from the New Hampshire governor.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
