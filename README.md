<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of issues affecting people all over the world right now. In the U.S., there were devastating wildfires in Maui that destroyed Lahaina and killed many people, which was due to an influx of invasive plants on land that was previously kept clear for plantation purposes. On top of this, the search of a small newspaper office by federal authorities has been raising concerns about press freedom. Meanwhile, support for green energy is on the rise and Trump is benefiting from criminal charges being brought against Hunter Biden. In Iran, people are protesting government policies in a religious form by chanting Ashura during annual rituals. Lastly, since pandemic-era Medicaid coverage guarantees have ended in Texas, more than half a million people have been removed from the program - more than any other state.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
