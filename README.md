<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension and uncertainty in the United States around abortion rights following decisions from the Supreme Court. People are protesting in Washington DC as part of the March for Life rally to stand up for their beliefs. Across the world in Europe, particularly Ukraine, there is a conflict between NATO and Russia over the future of the region. A lot of people are frustrated with Germany&#39;s response in particular as they look to protect their own interests. Another issue on many people&#39;s minds is aging populations and how countries and businesses need to adjust to provide greater access to older workers. In Omaha, Nebraska billionaire Warren Buffett is pushing back against a proposed streetcar that many hope will boost the city. And finally, Netflix is releasing a series about Tennis which has caused investors to pour money into the sport, setting up what could be a transformative moment for its future.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
