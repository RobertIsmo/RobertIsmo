<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, US Vice President Kamala Harris is trying to regain the momentum that thrust her into the White House in 2020. Former President Donald Trump and his lawyer John F. Lauro are trying to overturn the election results, while Republican candidates flock to Iowa to prove themselves in a new era. 

Elsewhere, Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading Russians into a civilizational conflict with the West, while Ukraine has grown bolder by attacking Moscow-connected bridges. In the US, a pregnant woman was wrongfully arrested because of inaccurate facial recognition technology. 

In terms of entertainment, the movie &quot;Barbie&quot; has made it to $1 billion at the box office and England striker Alessia Russo scored her first World Cup goal last week. People in China are attempting to tell forbidden stories since many writers wish to capture everyday realities kept hidden by the government. 

The trucking firm Yellow that received a $700 million bailout has declared bankruptcy, which according to the Trump administration was supposed to make money for the federal government. Serial murders have lessened due to improved technology, but sociopaths have shifted their methods of mayhem. Finally, an ongoing conflict on Cape Cod is centered around some dune shacks, as locals, activists, and artists plead their case against the National Park Service who want to lease them out.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
