<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is dealing with a potential cash shortage in June and Ukraine is making offensive maneuvers against Russia to potentially prepare for diplomatic talks. There are also a lot of issues surrounding asylum seekers elsewhere who are being taken advantage of by gangs and officials. In China, the government is becoming increasingly protective and security-minded under Xi Jinping and cracking down on foreign-affiliated businesses while ignoring their economic needs.

Meanwhile, Paris is making progress on having Olympic swimming in the Seine river ahead of the 2024 Summer Games and New York is getting ready to implement congestion pricing in some of its busiest parts. Closer to home, people are forming &#39;mommunes&#39; where they live together to split household bills and raise children as a group. 
And lastly, after 25 years since &quot;Seinfeld&quot; went off the air, it&#39;s become more relevant than ever in our era of re-evaluated priorities.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
