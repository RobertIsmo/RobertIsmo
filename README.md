<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of big stories happening in the world right now. In a sharp reversal from his predecessor, President Biden opened a path for Ukraine to get fighter jets. On the domestic front, Republican lawmakers are taking a hard line on military aid to Ukraine, while the centrist &#39;No Labels&#39; is pushing for a third-party run in 2024, with some Democrats worried about the consequences. 

In the sports world, there was sad news that Jim Brown, the Football great and civil rights champion, recently died at 87. His legacy (as with many others) was stained by allegations of abuse against women. 

On the international stage, Greece has been caught abandoning migrants at sea, and US diplomats reportedly shredded passports and stranded locals as they evacuated an embassy in Sudan. Meanwhile, FBI officials have violated surveillance rules after both George Floyd protests and othe Jan 6 attack.

Closer to home we’ve seen Florida Gov. DeSantis trying to boost his retail campaigning efforts in New Hampshire, and Democratic Congressman Jamaal Bowman arousing controversy by publicly confronting Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Green.

Lastly, NYC mourned the death of Rev. Timothy Keller at 72—an evangelist who gained fame by shunning fire and brimstone messaging and eventually starting Redeemer Presbyterian Church which drew many young New Yorkers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
