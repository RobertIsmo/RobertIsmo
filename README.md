<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of political turmoil in the United States. In Colorado, a court ruled that former president Donald Trump is ineligible to hold office again due to his involvement in the insurrection. Voters in Colorado and everywhere are feeling uneasy about this ruling and it&#39;s likely to go to the Supreme Court. 

Over in China, they are investing heavily in the modernization of an old military base called Lop Nur for nuclear tests. Meanwhile, in Yemen, the Houthi militia has been attacking ships they believe are connected to Israel and they refuse to back down until the siege in Gaza ends. 

In New York City, antisemitism and protests have spilled onto the streets and Jewish people are trying to find their way through the tension. Former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is also facing scrutiny as the FBI investigates his efforts to oust the American ambassador from Ukraine potentially motivated by his own financial issues. 

On a lighter note, some baking companies have noticed that shape-shifting cookie cutters can tell us a lot about what people are thinking and predicting for future economies such as in 2023. Lastly, drones are giving Ukraine some success at sea as they fight Russia with help from the White House.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
