<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world seems to be facing a lot of unrest right now. In the UK, there&#39;s a cost-of-living crisis with families struggling to even feed their children. The US is grappling with gun violence, especially mass shootings and gangs targeting entire families. Ukraine is facing an intense battle and the potential encirclement of one of its cities. Meanwhile, people are fighting against fake reviews online and discussing whether members of the royal family should be expected to bear such immense scrutiny.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
