<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

There seems to be a lot going on in the world right now. The Federal Reserve is signaling more rate increases, which may impact mortgages and credit cards. In sports, Morocco made an impressive showing at the World Cup but fell short of winning. There was tragic news in health, as well, as journalist Grant Wahl tragically passed away due to a burst blood vessel.

In the realm of international affairs, Russia is reinforcing its presence in Ukraine with an extensive defense system while also launching drones into Kyiv. Meanwhile, the United States is attempting to strengthen ties with African nations after being outpaced by China&#39;s influence and investments on the continent. Closer to home, there was a disastrous fire at a Police Department storage facility in Brooklyn that destroyed crucial evidence for unsolved cases. Additionally, some extremists reportedly attended a Republican gathering in Manhattan, raising questions about the party&#39;s path forward.

Finally, good news for New York City: its restaurant scene is beginning to bounce back with new top-notch places to eat popping up all over!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
