<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of big things happening in the world right now. President Biden is considering providing Ukraine with weapons banned by many U.S. allies, which could cause issues with civilian casualties due to cluster munitions. On the health front, a new Alzheimer&#39;s drug has become widely accessible after being given full approval by the FDA, but a black-box warning accompanied the decision due to potential safety risks. And speaking of safety risks, two Newark firefighters recently died in an unexpected blaze that was too intense for them to keep up with while they lacked proper equipment. 

Heat records around the globe are being broken as temperatures surge due to effects of greenhouse gases and El Niño. In addition, countries are aiming to zero out shipping emissions by midcentury so cargo ships can operate with zero-emissions fuel, and Treasury Secretary Yellen will be visiting China soon to discuss export controls, tariffs, and not wanting to harm their economy. John Kerry is set to join as well in order to restart climate negotiations with China - the biggest polluter of them all.

Finally, Tom Brady&#39;s attempt at getting into the crypto space didn&#39;t work out so well after the crypto market crashed, and luckily other celebrities like Taylor Swift avoided any losses.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
