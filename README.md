<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of political unrest going on in the world right now. In Odesa, a missile hit a cemetery and left a crater at the site where a woman&#39;s father was buried. In Israel, protests are simmering as their President prepares to address Congress about plans to overhaul the judiciary. In Florida, swimmers are taking a dip in water that is reaching record temperatures off the coast of south Florida due to climate change. Meanwhile, some economists are predicting that a recession may be on the horizon in the near future because of rising interest rates. On the culture front, 50 rappers have come together to tell the story of how hip-hop has grown over five decades from an art form to a powerful force in popular culture. In movies, Christopher Nolan released &quot;Oppenheimer,&quot; a complex portrait of the “father of the atomic bomb,” while Greta Gerwig produced “Barbie” which takes us out of the box and onto new adventures. Finally, there is concern about an injury epidemic in women&#39;s soccer with no explanation yet as to why it is happening or how to fix it.</p>

<h3>Could the Recession in the Distance Be Just a Mirage?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
