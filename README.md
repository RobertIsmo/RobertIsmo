<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. US President Biden is pushing for a $6.8 trillion budget proposal with new social programs and higher taxes. He is also trying to recapture his centrist identity in preparation for a campaign for his second term. Ex-President Trump&#39;s lawyer has admitted to making false claims about election fraud, which could mean criminal charges for him soon. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has laid out its terms for normalizing relations with Israel, and Russia recently attacked Ukrainian cities using advanced missiles, raising questions about its capability. Here in the US, there have been reports of abusive policing in Louisville and Mitch McConnell was hospitalized after slipping at a Washington hotel. Health concerns are also growing after a train derailment in Ohio, and book librarians are urging people to handle rare books without gloves.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
