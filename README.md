<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of conflict in the world. In Subfreezing Cold, Waves of Russian Missiles Batter Ukraine, leaving people without heat or water. Also, a Russian official in Africa was wounded by a package bomb. On a different note, it looks like this winter is going to be pretty bad due to high hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses - what&#39;s being called the &quot;Tripledemic&quot;. On top of that, new COVID booster shots have been found to cut the risk of hospitalization by half. Closer to home, there are investigations into Donald Trump&#39;s tax data as well as emails from his lawyers in relation to attempting to reverse the 2020 election outcome. And finally, there have been several instances of people not getting what they paid for - including at a concert in Mexico with Bad Bunny where people spent over a month&#39;s salary just to be turned away.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
