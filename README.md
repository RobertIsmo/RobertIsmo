<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of focus on the geopolitical issues happening around the world. In Ukraine, there is military graft and corruption in the government that has been coming to light and President Volodymyr Zelensky is facing criticism for it. In the US Navy, they are trying to adjust to changing threats with new vessels but there is a push for traditional ships due to political influence and jobs. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton&#39;s impeachment trial is starting Tuesday and his future in the Republican Party is uncertain. In China, their leader Xi Jinping may be skipping the annual G20 summit, which is being held in India this year. Lastly, in the UK, their Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is trying to harness divisive politics as they move toward an election next year.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
