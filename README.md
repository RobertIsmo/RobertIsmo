<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! U.S. politician DeSantis is facing criticism for new Black History standards, and A.I. companies have agreed to guardrails on their new tools in response to President Biden&#39;s pressure. On the other hand, there are still no clear rules about regulating A.I. in the U.S., and a grand jury is getting ready to make a decision on whether or not Trump and his allies will face charges related to election interference. Plus, Michael Cohen has agreed to settle his lawsuit against a Trump Organization, and Judge Cannon is making a case about Trump documents in 2024. There&#39;s also some heartwarming news: Tony Bennett, a famous crooner of the American songbook, recently passed away at age 96 and there was a very successful duet between him and Lady Gaga! And finally, Biden nominated Admiral Lisa Franchetti as first female head of the Navy, and William J. Burns as C.I.A Director and Cabinet member of his administration due to his role in pushing back against Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p>

<h3>An Untested Judge in the Trump Documents Case</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
