<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, in Ukraine there is a war going on that has resulted in the death and injury of nearly half a million people. In response to this, Ukrainian citizens who object to the war are facing criticism and prison time for not serving. Meanwhile, in East Asia, President Biden is hosting a summit to unite Japan, South Korea, and the United States against an increasingly assertive China. Back in the United States, Donald Trump is facing several criminal indictments and some of his supporters from the Proud Boys group are being sentenced for their involvement in the attack at the Capitol on January 6. A lawyer who was associated with Alex Jones was seen outside of Capitol Hill during the event as well, though it&#39;s not known why. Additionally, further south in the US, Hurricane Hilary is wreaking havoc on southwestern states and other places. As a result of all these events, states are trying to figure out how to redesign or otherwise change their flag design.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
