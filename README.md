<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of conflict and tension in the world. In the Middle East, Palestinian militants from Gaza attacked Israel on Saturday, killing and abducting hundreds. Israel is trying to figure out if there was a failure in intelligence so they could have prevented it. Also, Afghanistan has been hit with devastating earthquakes that have destroyed entire villages and killed many people.

In other news, unions have been striking for better wages and working conditions. Employers appear to be taken aback by the tactics being used. And as far as environmental news goes, there is a push to cut back on emissions by using wind power in shipping.

There have been some hopeful moments too. Farid El Haïry was convicted of rape and now his accuser changed her story and he has been exonerated after decades of wrongfully being labelled a criminal. And Jack Fisk, the genius behind the most memorable movie sets has brought the past to life. 

It&#39;s also important that we take time to appreciate moments of peace and normalcy. There are lots of delicious restaurants in San Francisco right now, so why not take a moment to enjoy good food while you&#39;re at it? :)</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
