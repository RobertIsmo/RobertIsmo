<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening around the world right now. In the business world, Wall Street banks have provided a large bailout to Teetering First Republic. Low rates are creating a rough ride in finance and the Federal government has blocked any mention of regulatory flaws that led to the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank. 

In science, new data supports the theory that raccoon dogs at Wuhan Market could be linked to the origins of the pandemic. Meanwhile, in the US, the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled in favor of Constitutionally-protected abortion. 

In sports, Princeton pulled off a big upset against Arizona in March Madness and another Cinderella story happened with Furman defeating Virginia. Over in France, President Macron pushed through a law raising retirement age without parliamentary support, risking serious backlash. 

Poland announced it would give Ukraine warplanes for defense against Russian forces and the Pentagon released a video of US drone&#39;s encounter with two Russian jets, allegedly sprayed with jet fuel. As for TikTok alsories matters, Biden is pushing for its owners to sell it or face possible ban, but finding a buyer may be harder than expected. Lastly, there is an effort to resolve the Israel&#39;s impasse on how to pick judges but it seems to have stalled.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
