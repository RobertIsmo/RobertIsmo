<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In Ukraine, the government has launched rare missile strikes against Russia and is making slow advances towards taking better shots at their targets. Ukrainians have even been able to find time for a wedding in the midst of all this, as a charity group has started to organize such celebrations for female service members. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian fencer was recently guaranteed a spot in the Paris Olympics despite having been penalized for refusing a Russian handshake.

Closer to home in the US, Former President Donald Trump is facing charges related to obstruction of justice and The Mystery of How Tim Scott’s Campaign Is Spending Its Millions still remains unanswered. Meanwhile, Republicans Ron DeSantis and Tim Scott are clashing over Florida’s educational standards and an AIDS relief program is being threatened by a dispute over abortion. Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman is adjusting to life in the Senate while new Black History Standards implemented in Florida have been met with backlash.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
