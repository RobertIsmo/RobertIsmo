<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there has been a lot happening in the world. In Mexico, authorities are investigating a deadly fire at a detention center for migrants as a potential homicide. In Washington, D.C., Republicans have rejected calls from President Biden to act on gun violence, instead pushing for laws that would expand access to firearms. Following suit, states like Kentucky and West Virginia have passed anti-trans laws that ban access to gender-transition care for young people. In New York, several people have been charged in connection with the killings of gay men who were drugged and robbed, spreading fear in the city&#39;s nightlife. President Biden also recently publicly criticized Israel over domestic policy, causing tension between the two countries. Meanwhile, soldiers have been massing near a Ukrainian nuclear plant, raising concern over what will happen in Europe&#39;s largest such plant. On top of this, former President Trump was interviewed by Fox News recently and the reception was relatively cool—even from his own network. Additionally, there is an ongoing push from liberals to implement race-based affirmative action and to limit access to housing in certain areas based on class instead of race. Lastly, there is also a growing effort for people to take action and sincerely reach out with prayers when tragedy strikes.</p>

<h3>Trump Says the Justice System Has Been Weaponized. He Would Know.</h3>

<h3>In the Face of Tragedy, Petitioning God Is an Act of Faith</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
