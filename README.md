<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a bloody stalemate in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine. Regulators are preparing to seize and sell First Republic, a troubled lender. In Hollywood, labor contract negotiations are heating up as unions representing writers and actors are pushing for limits on artificial intelligence. Also in the US, Donald Trump&#39;s legal jeopardy has grown with a rape case against him in New York and prosecution inquiry into illegal fundraising centered around claims of election fraud. Housebuyers around the US have been eager but sellers are scarce, creating &quot;real gridlock&quot;. Meanwhile, in Texas, a gunman killed 5 people and wounded 3 before fleeing. Finally, South Korea&#39;s leader is facing criticism for his foreign policy aligning more closely with Washington and Tokyo after receiving warmth from President Biden.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
