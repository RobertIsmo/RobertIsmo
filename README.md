<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. To start, Israel has launched an invasion of Gaza, which has been met with outrage from the international community. In Maine, it was revealed that authorities had been warned of a mass shooter&#39;s intentions months before he carried out one of this year&#39;s deadliest attacks. On the economic side, the Federal Reserve looks like it might hold interest rates steady which could mean higher wages over the summer and slower economic growth in the Eurozone. Meanwhile, people are debating whether candy corn is worthy of respect, Florida schools are trying to enforce phone bans to reduce student distractions, and Kenyan citizens are pushing their King for reparations for colonial abuses. Upstate New York farmers are dealing with financial disaster due to eight consecutive weekends of rain destroying their apple crops, but there&#39;s some good news too: the Biden administration recently approved the biggest offshore wind farm yet in Virginia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
