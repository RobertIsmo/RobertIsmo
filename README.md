<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, a new poll found that there is wide disapproval of President Biden’s stance on the Gaza conflict, especially among younger voters. This divide between those wanting the war to end and those pressing for a definitive Israeli victory has sparked a lot of discussion. Additionally, President Trump continues to make use of grievance politics in order to resonate with his followers, despite many more traditional bread-and-butter G.O.P. issues remaining popular. 

On top of that, Israelis have been abandoning the political left due to fears around security after a devastating Oct 7th terrorist attack. This shift towards right-wing politics has seemed to be encouraged by the success of the Houthi militia in Yemen as they challenged Israel with more than harsh words. 

There have been reports of Russia flouting global tech bans to obtain the components it needs to keep its economy and war going. Similarly, opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny has gone missing after he did not appear at a court hearing two weeks ago and no one have heard from him since. He is yet to be found despite his allies desperately searching for him. 

2020 was a tough year for many and it was capped off by Iceland&#39;s volcano eruption on Monday which was larger than originally predicted and took place near evacuated town and a power plant - luckily air travel didn&#39;t appear to be affected. Furthermore, key drugs for cancer patients have been in short supply due to a deep crisis in the generic drug industry.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
