<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, there are volunteers who have taken up arms to fight against Russia, and a Ukrainian unit is tinkering with tape, a scale, and a 3-D printer to transform a fragment grenade into a tank-killer. Despite destruction from shelling during the Orthodox Christmas, some families are defiantly celebrating the holiday. Meanwhile, in Asia, populations are aging faster than any other region in the world, with older generations continuing to work into their 70s and beyond. 

In the US, House Republicans have planned a special subcommittee led by a Trump ally to scrutinize FBI and intelligence agencies. There was also a lot of intraparty strife yesterday, leading up to the election of Speaker Kevin McCarthy. There has been some criticism over him in his hometown as well; particularly after a lecturer at Hamline University lost her job for displaying an artwork of the Prophet Muhammad (which many scholars say is a masterpiece). VP Biden has been visiting the southern border due to the increase of immigrants crossing over, and in New York City migrants from other countries are struggling but also settling in. Finally, China is lifting their pandemic border controls which is causing mixed feelings of anticipation and anxiety at home and abroad.</p>

<h3>The House Is in Ruins, but the Holiday Feast Goes On</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
