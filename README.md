<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. The Biden administration is making a wartime visit to Israel following an explosion at a hospital there. Tensions between Israel and Hamas have led to criticism and accusations of American hypocrisy in the Middle East, with the possibility of a wider conflict with Hezbollah looming. In the US, Republicans are divided over who should be their speaker with 20 refusing to vote for Representative Jim Jordan. There has also been a surge in international arms sales due to conflicts between Israel and Hamas, Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine and the rise of China. Ukraine used powerful American-supplied missiles for the first time against Russia, and the US is trying to make India into an ally by helping them repair ships. Finally, China&#39;s economy has been getting a boost from Beijing but real estate is suffering.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
