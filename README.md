<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, Florida governor Ron DeSantis&#39; enthusiasm for a vaccine has diminished recently, leading to an increase in Covid hospitalizations and deaths. In Belarus, there has been a prolonged government-led crackdown on protesters following a disputed election three years ago. In Ukraine, tensions with Russia are heightened as their leader, Zelensky, pushes to send grain through the Black Sea. Venezuela&#39;s broken oil industry is leading to environmental pollution across towns and lakes. Japan is attempting to make coal cleaner in an effort that may have many hurdles to overcome. Furthermore, there are a few heated debates occurring in California over LGBTQ issues. Additionally, developers in New York have not been delivering on their promises to the city which has a significant impact. Finally, there are elections taking place in Spain that could potentially result in the rise of far-right parties in the government&#39;s power structure. 

On the entertainment side of things, Yoko Ono left her iconic apartment at the Dakota building on the Upper West Side after living there for 50 years. Meanwhile, two huge Hollywood movies - &quot;Barbie&quot; and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; - will have their premieres this weekend, but an industry still on pause has dampened any celebratory moods.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
