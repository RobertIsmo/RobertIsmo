<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, President Biden is facing a major decision on the debt limit and American consumers are spending despite rising interest rates. Inflation is still high, but the forces driving it have shifted from goods to services. There&#39;s been a resurgence of attention on the murder of Emmett Till from nearly 70 years ago that galvanized the civil rights movement, and more recently an Airman accused of a leak who has a history of racist and violent remarks. Judy Blume&#39;s coming-of-age novel &quot;Are You There, God? It&#39;s Me, Margaret&quot; is finally being adapted for film. 

In sports news, WNBA player Brittney Griner is advocating for detainee rights while Ukrainian troops work to fend off Russian attacks as they await arms from the West. The US government announced sanctions on Russia&#39;s intelligence agencies and Iran&#39;s due to detention of Americans. 

In entertainment, host of the raucous talk show &quot;Jerry Springer&quot; has died at the age of 79. And in Montana, transgender legislator Zooey Zephyr is barred from joining her colleagues on floor proceedings so she reports to work in a Capitol hallway.</p>

<h3>Inflation Is Still High. What’s Driving It Has Changed.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
