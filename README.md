<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of tensions over antisemitism on university campuses recently, which has led to the resignations of some prominent university leaders. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has implemented a plan to keep Hamas contained and try to reduce the pressure for Palestinian statehood. Meanwhile, Egypt&#39;s president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is gaining increased popularity due to his involvement in the war in neighboring Gaza. In the US, there is widespread secondary arms market as weapons that were meant to be destroyed are instead being resurrected. And lastly, Dhonielle Clayton is trying to make the book world more diverse by selling ideas for commercial genre fiction featuring characters from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
