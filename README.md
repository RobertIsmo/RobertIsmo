<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of turmoil happening in the world right now. In Gaza, Israel has been attacking heavily and has caused the power and internet to go out across the region. The United States has conducted airstrikes against Iran in an attempt to modify their behavior. There was a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine that left 18 dead, and it&#39;s sparked a discussion on gun control laws. The crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried is currently on trial for financial fraud and his hair has been making headlines. Mike Johnson, a conservative from Louisiana, just became the new House speaker in Washington and is speaking out against abortion, gay marriage, and Ukraine aid. Lastly, Kanye West and Adidas have had a tumultuous relationship due to Kanye&#39;s antisemitic comments, as well as allegations of abuse behind the scenes.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
