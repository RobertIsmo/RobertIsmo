<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now the world is experiencing a lot of global tensions. In Ukraine, there is an ongoing conflict with Russia and Biden recently visited Kyiv to show support. There are also warnings of a growing rift between the US and China due to possible arms aid for Russia. Back at home, wealthy hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio extracted billions from his firm&#39;s profit before retiring. In response to Chinese aggression, Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos Jr.has adopted foreign policy closer to US interests. There is also a growing trend in telehealth involving the usage of psychedelic-like drugs with little known safety assurance. At the same time, the federal government announced they will end their investigation into strange unidentified flying objects without finding a concrete answer. But one thing that has been made clear is the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 in prison populations with death rates rising nearly 50%. Lastly, in New York, public money is being used to subsidize private religious school education for some residents.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
