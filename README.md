<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening around the world right now. In the US, there have been attempts to overturn the vote in Georgia and prosecutors are objecting to a proposal to discuss evidence at Mar-a-Lago. Meanwhile, a judge recently ruled in favor of Montana youths in a landmark climate case and many people lost their homes in a fire near Lahaina, Hawaii. 

Internationally, Russia has been firing warning shots and boarding a freighter in the Black Sea as tensions rise. Closer to home, American officials are trying to facilitate access and consular duties for an American journalist being detained by Russia.

In other news, Japan&#39;s economy is booming after the pandemic and we&#39;re starting to see some warm weather finally in the Northwest after a long cold winter. On top of all that, Charles McGonigal is being investigated by federal prosecutors after his career as an FBI Spy Hunter unraveled after reports of foreign dealings.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
