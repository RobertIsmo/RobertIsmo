<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a number of news stories happening around the world at the moment. In Russia, there are military strikes that are coming close to civilians in the Belgorod region, and in Ukraine there was a car bombing which was connected to Moscow&#39;s illegal annexation of an area. In India, tragically there has been a huge train disaster which has killed almost 300 people, and investigations are ongoing regarding a possible signal failure. 

In the US, President Biden has recently signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act which intends to prevent the nation running out of money for its obligations. Additionally, Trump&#39;s legal notes may be important in an inquiry into some classified documents. Furthermore, TikTok creators and influencers of all ages are prospering, and two Native American tribal members (one Black) were arrested under different laws due to their differing levels of &#39;Indian blood&#39;. Finally, Governor DeSantis went on his first campaign trip and received plenty of donations from big donors.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
