<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hi there! It’s been a busy few weeks in the world. In the US, former President Donald Trump is facing legal hurdles related to his involvement in the January 6th Capitol siege and his personal finances are struggling due to mounting legal bills. In China, their slowing economy has put other countries on notice, and they are feinting increasingly aggressive military activity against Taiwan. On the brighter side, there&#39;s a movement to reclaim stolen heritage items that were taken during European colonialism — it’s called Looty and it is enabling people from former colonies to virtually learn about their art and history. Lastly, though Iowa Democrats are despondent after repeated losses in the state, Republican presidential candidates are flocking to Iowa ahead of the 2024 election. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
