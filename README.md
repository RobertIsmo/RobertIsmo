<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is facing a lot of difficult issues. In New York, the city is struggling with a homelessness crisis due to an influx of migrants. In Texas, a body of a migrant was found in a buoy barrier in the Rio Grande after evidently drowning upstream. In Pennsylvania, a judge sentenced the Pittsburgh synagogue gunman to death following the murder of 11 people in the Tree of Life synagogue. There&#39;s also an ongoing dispute within Senator Dianne Feinstein&#39;s family over control of her late husband&#39;s estate. Additionally, firetruck chasers in New York are causing violence and threats, beatings and extortion. There are also potentially worrying implications from artificial intelligence creating and spreading falsehoods about people with little recourse to fight against it. On top of this, ocean temperatures are record-breaking highs this year, and this could have severe consequences for our planet. Finally, there&#39;s also been some political upheaval recently with President Trump being charged under a Reconstruction-era law, and public debates over the modern meritocracy and college admissions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
