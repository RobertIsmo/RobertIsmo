<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! The US economy is still doing well, with employers adding 311,000 jobs despite higher interests rates. But people&#39;s wages may be rising more slowly as more workers become available. In Mexico, criminals have started to violate their usual rule of leaving American citizens alone and are instead targeting them. There&#39;s also been a big shakeup in Silicon Valley, where Silicon Valley Bank failed after a run on deposits. This caused chaos for start-up companies who had money at the bank and had to scramble to get it out. Additionally, there&#39;s been news coming out of Saudi Arabia and Iran that they have agreed to resume ties after talks hosted by China, which shows them becoming increasingly powerful geopolitically. Lastly, people are keeping an eye on Donald Trump because it looks like there might be an indictment looming against him soon as his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is set to testify at a grand jury.</p>

<h3>Saudi Arabia and Iran Agree to Restore Ties, in Talks Hosted by China</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
