<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! An entrepreneur from the US named Ramaswamy is running for office, and has some interesting thoughts about his generation. Meanwhile, a Voter in Iowa is asking DeSantis why they should pick him over Trump. China&#39;s economic woes could affect the US economy, and Bob Barker, the long-time host of &#39;The Price Is Right&#39;, has passed away aged 99. He was a strong advocate for animal rights throughout his life. On Saturday, thousands gathered at the March on Washington to remember Martin Luther King&#39;s historic speech and its themes in modern day. There is an ongoing search for the &#39;Nemesis Bird&#39;, which remains elusive to birders, while Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner private militia, has reportedly passed away too - but not without controversy as some are saying he had blood on his hands. In response to ongoing war in Ukraine, musicians have put together an updated version of Beethoven&#39;s Ninth Symphony entitled &#39;Ode to Joy&#39;. In New York City, mourners are calling for charges after an NYPD Sergeant hit a man with a cooler leading to his death. And lastly, a judge&#39;s ruling on torture at Guantanamo could threaten US government cases from post-9&#x2F;11. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
