<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening around the world right now. First, a National Guardsman from Massachusetts was arrested for leaking classified documents to an online chat group. Then, the Florida Legislature passed a six-week abortion ban, meaning it will no longer be possible for women from across the Deep South to get abortions in Florida. The Supreme Court is also about to consider a case that could restrict access to abortion in some states across the U.S. Meanwhile, there is also news coming out of San Francisco where a tech consultant has been arrested in connection with the killing of Cash App creator Bob Lee. Finally, former President Donald Trump is in legal trouble after witnesses have testified against him in his election fraud case. A billionaire businessman is also funding the lawsuit accusing Trump of rape.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
