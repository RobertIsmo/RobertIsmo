<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In Ukraine, troops are repelling Russian attacks and hoping Western arms will help them turn the tide of battle. In the US, Vice President Mike Pence has appeared before a grand jury to testify about former President Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to retain power. There&#39;s also a legal battle between Trump&#39;s lawyer and E. Jean Carroll, who has accused him of rape. Additionally, the woman who accused 14-year-old Emmett Till of accosting her before his death, Carolyn Bryant Donham, passed away at 88 years old. 

In related news, Jerry Springer was honored as an &quot;American Ringmaster&quot; and in Montana, a transgender lawmaker was barred from participating in the legislative session on the House floor. Montana Governor&#39;s nonbinary son called on him to reject current transgender bills in the state. Pope Francis returned to Hungary much to the delight of Viktor Orban.

President Biden is facing his first big choice on debt limit. While House Republicans squeezed through a bill that would raise debt limits and cut spending, there are more negotiations yet to come. A state budget deal was reached in New York that would raise minimum wage and change bail laws after weeks of negotiation between Gov. Kathy Hochul and lawmakers. Lastly, abortion bans failed in South Carolina and Nebraska due to lack of votes from conservative legislatures.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
