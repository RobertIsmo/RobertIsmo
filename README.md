<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now things are looking a bit turbulent both domestically and internationally. In the US, President Biden is preparing to visit Kyiv, Ukraine as he seeks to challenge Vladimir Putin’s presence in the region. Meanwhile, Bruce’s Beach in Los Angeles had just sold for $20 million, prompting debate about reparations for their seizure nearly a century ago. 

On the business front, hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio is retiring with a huge exit package. Ketamine is also becoming quite popular in telehealth for mental health conditions, even though there is still very limited evidence about its safety.

Internationally, an earthquake has just struck southwest Turkey which adds to the devastation from the February quake that killed more than 46,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The Philippines has also been expanding its foreign policy due to worries over China’s aggression.

And finally on a more interesting note, Alec Baldwin has had his manslaughter charges downgraded due to a technicality related to gun laws and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire is eyeing a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Oh and there&#39;s also some intriguing news about UFOs at the end of the world!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
