<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, there&#39;s a key vote that could potentially change how things are run in the country and it&#39;s causing profound rifts between people. Meanwhile, here in the United States there is an ongoing battle between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu over what should be done with Israel&#39;s judiciary system. On top of that, the justice system is pouring resources to scrutinizing Trump. Since people have started to venture out more, there has been a resurgence in Molly-coddling and flaunting status symbols which is being looked into. We also see politicians gearing up for upcoming elections here in the US with some races particularly competitive- especially in San Francisco where London Breed seems to have lost some of her popularity with her constituents. In addition, Spain just had some inconclusive elections that left everyone wondering who will lead next, as well as a new lager from Mexico rising to replace Bud Light as America&#39;s favorite beer choice. Last but not least, movie theaters are opening again- we saw fans flocking to screenings of Barbie which allowed us to reclaim some sense of the usual liveliness and fun going on before the pandemic!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
