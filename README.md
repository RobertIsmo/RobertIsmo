<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Israel, there has been a violent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that U.S. officials are urging to stop from escalating any further. There are also ongoing land and air battles with Palestinians in the Middle East. Back in the U.S., there has been a bitter internal struggle among Republicans over who should lead the House of Representatives, as well as a scandal involving a lawyer working for President Trump who has plead guilty to election fraud in Georgia. In Hawaii, there has been a devastating wildfire that destroyed Lahaina which is prompting conservators to race to save what remains of its culture and heritage. Finally, college sports have seen some major changes due to the donations of wealthy boosters and more relaxed rules that could help student-athletes, but may cost universities and taxpayers money.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
