<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot has been going on around the world lately. In Russia, Vladimir Putin is mobilizing his people for a civilizational conflict with the West. Meanwhile, Ukraine is taking matters into their own hands against Russian-occupied Crimea. 
In the US, Kamala Harris is playing an important role as Biden&#39;s Vice President in the 2024 campaign, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has been making a lot of trips to Iowa for some retail politics. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39;s potential presidential bid has caused some tension within his family. Polls have been indicating that some Republican voters may be exhausted from their ongoing &quot;war on wokeness&quot;. 
These are just the headlines! There was this really interesting case of Porcha Woodruff who was eight months pregnant when she was wrongfully arrested for carjacking because of a false facial recognition match. Also, Megan Rapinoe had some disappointment with her World Cup career ending with a missed penalty kick. Serial murderers have been surprisingly dwindling due to increased measures of caution and technological advances, as Gabbi Tuft recently transitioned and began a new life as a TikTok star. Finally, prosecutors are trying some novel strategies to catch up with all the pandemic fraud going on.</p>

<h3>Anguish in Camelot: Kennedy Campaign Roils Storied Political Family</h3>

<h3>Are G.O.P. Voters Tiring of the War on ‘Wokeness’?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
