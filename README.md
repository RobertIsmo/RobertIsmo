<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of unrest and change going on around the world. In the US, there are ongoing debates about police reform and a long-shot presidential attempt to negotiate a deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel. In Russia, the government is shifting its battlefield tactics due to costly mistakes from the past. Meanwhile, Ukraine is facing threats of disease outbreaks in flood regions. On a more human-level, there has been an attack on a school in Uganda that resulted in 37 casualties, and some people in Missouri are turning to motor scooters as a solution to commuting trouble. Lastly, Covid-19 has caused big shifts when it comes to air quality regulations.</p>

<h3>The New War on Bad Air</h3>
<sub>By Emily Anthes</sub>
<p>A century ago, a well-ventilated building was considered good medicine. But by the time Covid-19 arrived, our buildings could barely breathe. How did that happen?

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
