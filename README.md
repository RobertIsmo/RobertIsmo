<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In China, scientists are facing censorship pressures as they try to study Covid-19. In Sudan, a power struggle has broken out and people are being displaced by the fighting. With the opioid crisis ongoing, it was revealed that millions of dollars had been donated to an organization that advises on opioid policy by members of the Sackler family. In Virginia, an alumnus is on the Board who has attacked diversity programs at the University. In Ukraine, Russian troops have been evacuating civilians from occupied areas in the South. On a lighter note, there&#39;s an island off of Scotland for sale although it isn&#39;t quite ready yet for human habitation. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond declared bankruptcy due to not being able to keep up with online shopping. Banning menthol cigarettes has created a divide among Black leaders, and some Republican legislatures are trying to make it harder to get issues onto state ballots after abortion rights supporters swept ballot measures last year. Finally, there are two reviews for entertainment - a remake of Dead Ringers that takes on childbirth from a new perspective, and the great debate over Crumbl cookies.</p>

<h3>Black Smokers at Center of New York Fight to Ban Menthol Cigarettes</h3>

<p>A proposal to make New York the third state to ban menthol cigarettes has created a furious and expensive lobbying war, and has divided Black leaders.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3LmeRTs"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
