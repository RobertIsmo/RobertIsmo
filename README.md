<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, former President Trump&#39;s allies are trying to pressure Florida&#39;s Governor DeSantis ahead of a likely indictment and New York authorities are preparing for an unprecedented arrest of an ex-president. Meanwhile, China and Russia are getting closer than ever, with Chinese officials saying President Xi Jinping’s upcoming trip to Moscow is a peace mission, while U.S. and European officials are skeptical. On the global front, banks around the world are under pressure following a rescue deal arranged by Swiss regulators, while the Federal Reserve meets to discuss whether and by how much to raise interest rates this week. Outside of North America, Iraq is reflecting on 20 years since the US-led invasion, and Mexican workers are being poisoned by lead from old car batteries discarded mostly in the US. Finally, supporters of Jennifer Fox have learned more details about her rape allegations against sports legend—it&#39;s shocking but unfortunately very common.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
