<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things seem to be a bit of a mess right now in the world. Recently, there was a deadly earthquake that caused damage in Turkey and Syria, and governments like the United States and the European Union sent rescue teams to help. China is also in the news right now because they&#39;ve been sending balloons over Latin America and this has caused tension between them and the United States. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, there&#39;s been an intensifying conflict with Russia that&#39;s taking a toll on people&#39;s lives. Here in the United States, we&#39;ve seen an immigration rebound that&#39;s helping ease worker shortages, but there are still large visa backlogs. Lastly, the Grammys were just held and they had some great moments like Questlove assembling a crash course in hip-hop history and Beyoncé making her priorities known.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
