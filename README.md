<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on around the world. There is an ongoing conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas which has led to challenging assumptions about politics in the region and how much influence the US still has there. Another conflict is playing out in Ukraine, where people skeptical of Western countries’ actions are complicating international attempts to preserve democracy. In Venezuela, a presidential primary is underway with a candidate who opposes current President Maduro hoping to gain ground. In the US, trade unions have expanded their strike against Detroit automakers and rising inequality between rich and poor students was highlighted recently by SAT test scores. Finally, Philadelphia&#39;s restaurant scene is having a moment as diners are able to enjoy diverse cuisine from all around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
