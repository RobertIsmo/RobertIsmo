<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In terms of technology, there&#39;s a congressional hearing happening about TikTok which is owned by a Chinese company. Teens have been skeptical about the company&#39;s efforts to combat screen time as it&#39;s still easy for them to stay on the app. People have been increasingly worried about the threat of TikTok from national security perspectives. It&#39;s become a battleground for tech leadership between the U.S. and China.

In bank-related news, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates while acknowledging that bank turmoil could slow down the economy. The Bank of England also raised rates in response to persisting inflation. Officials from both banks are considering further actions&#x2F;rules to rein in banks but they&#39;re still not sure what that looks like yet.

Finally, in Memphis, police have been using seizures to tackle street racing and other crimes, although this has caused controversy as people are left without their cars even if they haven&#39;t actually been convicted of a crime. In Turkey, there has been an earthquake recently that devastated one historic street and its shops, including doner kebab shops, along with a historic church and barber shop. There&#39;s also a water crisis ballooning in Jackson, Mississippi where one leak alone is dumping 5 million gallons daily.</p>

<p>This month, the company announced a new 60-minute “daily screen time limit” for users under 18.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
