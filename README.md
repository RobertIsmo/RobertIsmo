<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seem to be a lot of conflicts going on around the world right now. The US is warning China over giving military aid to Russia for the war in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin is dealing with setbacks for his invasion in that country. Back in the US, President Biden is getting ready for the 2024 election by framing it as a contest between himself and a conspiracy-minded opposition. Nikki Haley is testing the views on sexism in her party with a presidential campaign, while people from East Palestine are testing their own toxic chemical exposure from a train derailment rather than trusting what the government offers. Additionally, there was recently a Parisian cathedral that&#39;s been around for more than 600 years and there several people out there such as Andrew Tate who are trying to “brainwash” generations by promoting sexist views online. Lastly, Facebook has started charging users for an account status while experts are trying to verify whether an American painting taken by British Navy during the Revolutionary War is authentic or not.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
