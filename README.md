<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got some interesting news from around the world. In Ukraine, there&#39;s been a challenge to political corruption after the defense minister was removed. The US Navy is facing evolution threats and is attempting to adapt, while Texas attorney general Ken Paxton is under conservative pressure to avoid impeachment. At 97, Elaine LaLanne has become a model for aging well as a first lady of fitness, while Smash Mouth&#39;s old lead singer Steve Harwell passed away last week. Thousands of Burning Man attendees were stranded in Nevada due to torrential rain over the weekend and may be able to leave on Monday. Paul McCartney&#39;s lost bass guitar from his Beatles days is being searched for now in a new campaign, meanwhile CNN anchor Anderson Cooper has opened up about his own grief during childhood. Lastly, countries are making progress towards clean energy use through investments in Congolese solar power, while The Folk Implosion recently reunited during the pandemic to release more music since their 1999 LP.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
