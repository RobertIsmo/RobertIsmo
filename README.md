<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news lately related to politics, climate change, and business. The Supreme Court recently rejected a voting map that would have diluted the power of Black voters, which caused concern that the Voting Rights Act would be undermined. In other news, record levels of pollution and heat have been heralded by a season of climate extremes, while prosecutors told President Trump&#39;s legal team that he is the target of an investigation. Additionally, Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the flood zone in the wake of calling for a rapid global response, while cross-border skirmishes in Ukraine have increased anxiety for local villagers. 

In U.S. news, Pat Robertson, who gave Christian conservatives clout, passed away at 93 and House Republicans have found themselves in chaos due to far-right rebels mutinying against their leader. The FBI director has agreed to more widely distribute a document on a claim against President Biden after the Oversight Committee threatened to begin contempt proceedings against him, and the government will need to take on massive amounts of borrowing due to debt limit standoffs and pandemic spending. Finally, there&#39;s an issue with feral cats in New York streets as pet abandonment has become an issue after the pandemic pet boom resulted in a population surge; this has raised controversy about how to control their numbers. CNN&#39;s current turmoil has also raised questions on whether there is room for independent cable news outlets today.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
