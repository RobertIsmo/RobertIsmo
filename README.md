<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of natural disasters happening around the world right now. In California and Mexico, a rare hurricane is creating disaster-preparedness in both regions. There are concerns about &quot;catastrophic&quot; flooding in Southern California as Hurricane Hilary moves north, and wildfires are ravaging Canada and forcing evacuations. West Virginia University has had to slash its budget due to state funding cuts, and has had to cut areas like world languages and creative writing programs. Meanwhile, Donald Trump plans to skip the Republican National Debate for an interview with Tucker Carlson, which could potentially disrupt ties with America&#39;s allies in the Indo-Pacific region, while Republicans try to determine who will make it to the next debate.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
