<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is seeing some changes lately. Airfare prices seem to have tumbled, resulting in lower inflation, and food prices are rising a bit more slowly. On the political side, Biden is promoting his policies as inflation eases and Erdogan showed signs of repairing ties with the U.S. Meanwhile, countries are paying more for their own military expenses because of Russia&#39;s appropriation of Ukraine. There&#39;s also news coming out of the technology sector: Microsoft won a ruling against the F.T.C., which has enabled it to go ahead with larger deal-making. The ocean temperatures off Florida are reaching 90 degrees Fahrenheit, indicating severe risks for marine life and the environment overall. Purdue scientists have devised an innovative new paint that can reduce the surface temperature when applied. In literary news, Milan Kundera recently passed away at 94 -- he was known for writing about human absurdity in Czechoslovakia. Finally, Vermont was hit by devastating floods recently and more rain is expected this week.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
