<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world recently. In the Middle East, President Biden is dealing with inner divisions over the conflict in Gaza, but there&#39;s been a ceasefire that has benefited both sides, at least for now. The Pope has had to cancel his trip to the UN Climate Summit, and he&#39;s also evicted an American Cardinal from his Vatican home after some pointed criticism of the Pope. 

In other news, Charles T. Munger (one of Warren Buffett&#39;s right-hand men) recently passed away, and Rosalynn Carter was honored for her public service after her death at 96 years old. Former first ladies recently had a rare gathering that showed style and subtle differences. Additionally, the wife of Ukraine&#39;s Spy Chief was poisoned, though she is recovering in the hospital.

On the business side of news, Corporate America luckily managed to dodge damage from high rates for now while Federal Officials have hinted that rate increases may be over and investors are cheering-- boosting stocks and bonds alike!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
