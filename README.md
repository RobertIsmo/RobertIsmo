<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Congress is considering providing aid to Israel, and some Democrats are attaching strings to the aid. In the West Bank, people are increasingly supporting Hamas after prisoners were released. Meanwhile, in Israel, there is internal pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to reject longer ceasefire terms with Hamas. 

Internationally, OPEC is trying to reduce supply due to an anticipated drop in demand in 2024. Federal law in the US forces a choice between marijuana use and owning firearms. In entertainment, TV shows had a noteworthy year despite many difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 

In news about Pope Francis, reports say he is evicting a US cardinal from his Vatican home because of disagreements with him. There is also an increasing level of enthusiasm for Haley&#39;s candidacy for president as she looks to take down current front-runner Donald Trump. Red-state Democrats in the Senate may be counting on abortion rights to help their re-election bids as well. Lastly, there are intense conflicts between chicken tycoons and antitrust hawks that President Biden&#39;s administration has failed to bridge satisfactorily.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
