<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are kicking off in the US as the trial of the Proud Boys militia is set to open, and there is the potential for criminal charges to be brought against Donald Trump following a report by an investigating House panel. On the sporting front, Argentina just won the World Cup title for the first time since 1986 and did it in dramatic fashion with Lionel Messi leading his nation to victory. Meanwhile, Russia is allegedly training their soldiers for a possible new offensive against Ukraine, and some evidence of Moscow’s true war losses is starting to come out. Elon Musk has been causing outrage on Twitter recently due to some grievances on social media linking between platforms, whilst Hiroyuki Nishimura receives celebrity status in Japan despite owning 4chan. In Peru, there have been some violent clashes between protesters and security forces which has resulted in 25 deaths and hundreds injured.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
