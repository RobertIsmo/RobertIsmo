<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are conflicts happening around the world between Israel and Hamas. In Israel, people have been waiting in fear for help as casualties increase from the attacks. At the same time, falsified content is circulating on social media in regards to the conflict. In the US, chaos has ensued as Republicans try to name a new Speaker of the House. Investors believe the Federal Reserve may not raise rates again after big market changes that are expected to reduce economic growth. Also in the US, there is a legal battle concerning racial gerrymandering when it comes to drawing voting maps. 

Meanwhile, a successful R&amp;B artist Usher has just released new music while in another news story, an AI tool has been developed to diagnose brain tumours during surgery. Additionally, an investigation looked into how an air traffic control lapse could have caused 131 plane passengers&#39; deaths in Texas.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
