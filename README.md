<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of conflict is happening across the world. In Gaza, people are mourning after Israeli airstrikes that killed dozens. Iran is accusing Israel of killing one of their top officials in a missile strike in Syria, and Ukraine and Russia continue to fight for control over Ukraine&#39;s territory. Meanwhile, Pope Francis has called for an end to the military campaign in Gaza in light of the &quot;appalling&quot; loss of life. In addition to that, we&#39;re starting to see some unusual trends emerge such as hobby crafts growing more popular with blacksmithing gaining traction and cryptocurrency mining becoming more widespread.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
