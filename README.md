<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, there is a big debate going on about the debt ceiling and how to manage the nation&#39;s borrowing limit. Republicans have proposed cuts to federal spending in exchange for lifting the limit. In Russia, prisoners with HIV are being forced onto the front lines of war because they don&#39;t have access to adequate medical care in prison. There was recently an accidental bombing of a Russian city, injuring three people. As part of their military aid package to Ukraine, the US has just sent them anti-tank land mines that will be lethal indefinitely. Meanwhile in the US, there is an ongoing discussion about the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and the states where abortion is currently banned. Finally, scientists have been examining an unusual experiment in Belgium involving taking in mentally ill people into family homes and using video chat technology with parrots. President Biden has also held few press conferences since he came into office— fewer than any president since Reagan.</p>

<h3>‘A Quick Death or a Slow Death’: Prisoners Choose War to Get Lifesaving Drugs</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
