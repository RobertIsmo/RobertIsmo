<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
An international war of words has broken out between Russia, China, and Iran who are backing Hamas. Stocks have had a wild week due to conflicting data reports and policies by policymakers. Some Jews are turning to Fox News for their coverage of the fight between Hamas and Israel as they feel other coverage is biased. Meanwhile, Hezbollah&#39;s leader Hassan Nasrallah made his first public comments since the war began, saying that his powerful Lebanese militia has bogged down Israeli forces to help Hamas. Stocks have recently rallied while clean energy stocks have declined even with warnings about climate change. In Scotland’s Shetland Islands, hundreds of knitters from around the world now gather every year for their wool festival. Wildfires and natural disasters have been causing destruction across the US with Hawaii’s royal capital burning down in what was one of the hottest events of the year. Former President Trump is facing gag orders in both election and defamation lawsuits while his lawyers are attacking the judge’s clerk in his civil fraud trial. He was also found making false or misleading statements at a rally about Biden’s electric Army tank mandates and auto industry job losses. Lastly, Joe Biden met with the families of those killed or injured during last month’s shooting rampage in Maine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
