<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of news about the economy and money. The U.S. Federal Reserve is having a meeting this month and everyone is watching to see what decisions they make. In the meantime, manufacturing in the U.S. has slowed down, despite a recent rebound from the pandemic, which is hampering the recovery. There is a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now, as investors wonder what will happen if the Fed makes a &quot;shock pause&quot; in interest rate increases, and shares in regional lenders have fallen. 

In Europe, there&#39;s discussion of a &#39;peace dividend&#39; after years of conflict - but that comes with hard tradeoffs such as increased defense spending at the cost of social safety net programs and climate transition goals. Closer to home, there&#39;s been a tragic shooting in Texas where a man was arrested for killing 5 people, and questions have been raised about gun laws in the state. 

Meanwhile, wind power pioneer Henrik Stiesdal continues to keep up his fight against climate change by rolling out new green tech innovations; unfortunately 8th grade students across the US have seen their US history test scores drop for nearly a decade now - so that could be something we need to brush up on! In the NY area, rent controls could soon increase by 2-5%, and global cities like Barcelona are trying new containerization strategies that could force NYC to get rid of 150 thousand parking spots.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
