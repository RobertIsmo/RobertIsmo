<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a war going on between Ukraine and Russia in which both sides are turning to guerrilla tactics. Earlier this week, a Ukrainian missile attack on a Russian city killed at least 22 people, and US helicopters reportedly sank 3 Houthi boats in the Red Sea. In Israel, Arab and Jewish students are using dialogue to attempt to bridge divides in their society. Additionally, car tracking apps have been weaponized by abusive partners in the US, and inmates in Chile&#39;s oldest and least crowded prison have fallen in love with hundreds of stray cats. Finally, the NFL is almost at the end of its season, so many teams are vying for playoff spots.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
