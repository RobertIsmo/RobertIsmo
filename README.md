<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In Russia, the war has arrived at people&#39;s doorsteps, with cross-border strikes affecting the Belgorod region. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, a car bombing in the Zaporizhzhia region killed a cafe owner attempting to stand in elections seen as an attempt to legitimize Moscow’s illegal annexation of that area. In India, there has been the worst train disaster in decades, resulting in hundreds of fatalities due to suspected signal failure. Closer to home, US President Biden has signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act to end the debt limit crisis and ensure money can be paid out for two years. Additionally, Trump&#39;s former lawyer&#39;s notes may be vital evidence in an inquiry into classified documents. Finally, on a lighter note, TikTok creators are prospering from their jump onto the platform and brands are signing them up regardless of their age or finances.</p>

<h3>Two Black Members of Native Tribes Were Arrested. The Law Sees Only One as Indian.</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
