<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, the G.O.P. is in revolt over a debt limit deal between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy that could affect student loan payments and President Trump has been put under pressure by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to support this agreement. Meanwhile, a new law in Ukraine aimed at providing science and research funding has not lived up to expectations, and companies are pushing prices higher even though some business costs have gone down. Europe is also seeing high food prices because of inadequate agricultural policies. On a more positive note, there are plenty of summer books for us to read this season and in New York they are testing gas stoves to measure pollution levels. In other technology news, Elizabeth Holmes is reporting to prison for an 11 year sentence for fraud relating to her blood testing start-up Theranos, while A.I experts are warning about technological developments that could lead to our extinction in the future. Finally, my hometown of Berkeley is facing a battle between progressive newcomers and nostalgic old-timers over plans to build apartments on a prized back garden paradise.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
