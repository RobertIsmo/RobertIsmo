<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
We&#39;re entering the end of the pandemic pause on student loan payments, which could lower monthly bills for borrowers. The Supreme Court is hearing a major guns case involving domestic violence, and it will affect the rules around who can legally possess guns. In terms of admissions to universities and colleges, there is now an end to race-conscious admissions. In Europe, satellite imagery revealed hundreds of new tents at a potential base for a private military company in Belarus. New York City found that 18 Hasidic schools failed to provide adequate education to thousands of students. Fox News recently reached a settlement with a former producer over allegations of hostile workplace. Alan Arkin, a celebrated actor, passed away this week at the age of 89. There was discussion on Bridget Jones, an iconic character from 1998 who has become a relic from another time. There are rival camps forming in France over police shootings in recent days. Temperatures have been increasing this weekend both in the South and West of the United States, accompanied by smoke from the continued Canadian wildfires lingering over the Northeast and Midwest.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
