<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of activity going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there have been an uptick in attacks from Ukrainian forces, but U.S. officials don&#39;t seem too concerned. Meanwhile, President Biden has invited some international allies to Washington to discuss providing support to Kyiv as tension rises. Closer to home, the state of Oklahoma just approved the first religious charter school in the country, which will offer online Roman Catholic instruction funded by taxpayers – sparking debate about separation of church and state. Mike Pence is also running for president again in 2024 and challenging Trump. On top of that, Cornel West is entering the 2021 presidential race with a third-party bid under Bernie Sanders&#39; People’s Party. Then there&#39;s Robert Kennedy Jr., who has formed an alliance with Elon Musk and is promoting far-right ideas and misinformation from his presidential campaign platform. Lastly, Robert Hanssen – a former FBI agent exposed as a spy for Moscow – recently passed away, and Trump&#39;s lawyers are meeting with the Department of Justice as they near the end of their classified documents inquiry.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
