<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now! In China, a real estate market meltdown is leaving small businesses and workers waiting to be paid after they&#39;ve finished jobs. In Spain, tensions between those who embrace machismo and progressive movements have been recently highlighted after the country&#39;s soccer president forcibly kissed a player. The US is also dealing with current events, particularly in regards to Hurricane Ian that is ravaging the Gulf Coast. There&#39;s also a US federal election case that has been given a trial date for March and Tropical Storm Idalia that&#39;s expected to rapidly intensify near Florida&#39;s coast. As if this wasn&#39;t enough, there has also been a shooting in Jacksonville, Fla and Eminem has sent cease-and-desist letter to an aspiring rapper who tried to rap one of his songs. All in all, it&#39;s an interesting time in the world!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
