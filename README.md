<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! Former U.S. President Donald Trump is facing criminal prosecution, which has caused a lot of outrage from Republicans who think he is being treated unfairly. We also know that he paid hush money to a porn star, and might turn himself soon. In Russia, there was an arrest of an American reporter as the country continues to distance itself from the West in a move not seen since the Cold War. In France, locals are expressing anger towards President Macron, making their discontent known through protests and damaging public buildings like City Hall. Elsewhere, Big Tech stocks have masked turmoil in the stock market while Bitcoin&#39;s price has soared this month but investors see it as an uncertain financial alternative. Inflation rates continue to fall across the Eurozone and debates over transgender rights dominate conversations in Nebraska and Kentucky as local lawmakers try to ban transition-related medical treatment for young people.</p>

<h3>A President Faces Prosecution, and a Democracy Is Tested</h3>
<sub>By Peter Baker</sub>
<p>For more than two centuries, American presidents were effectively shielded from indictment. But the case against former President Donald J. Trump breaks that taboo and sets a new precedent.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/40PfiKN"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Republicans Erupt in Outrage and Rush to Defend the Defendant</h3>
<sub>By Michael C. Bender and Maggie Haberman</sub>
<p>Many in the party said Donald Trump could benefit from a wave of sympathy among Republicans, with his base of supporters likely to be energized by a belief in a weaponized justice system.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3M4FigY"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>What We Know About the Indictment of Donald Trump, and What Comes Next</h3>

<p>Mr. Trump was indicted over his role in paying hush money to a porn star, and likely plans to turn himself in on Tuesday, a lawyer has said.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3lVqDu1"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>For Ukrainian Convicts, a Strange Odyssey Through Russian Prisons</h3>
<sub>By Anatoly Kurmanaev, Ekaterina Bodyagina and Ivan Nechepurenko</sub>
<p>When Russian troops left Kherson, they took with them 2,500 Ukrainian convicts from local prisons. For some, it was the start of a bewildering, five-country journey highlighting the war’s absurdity.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/40wQgQO"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>In Arrest of American Reporter, Russia Doubles Down on Isolation From West</h3>

<h3>How Big Tech Camouflaged Wall Street’s Crisis in March</h3>

<p>Investors in the S&amp;P 500 are highly dependent on the fate of Microsoft, Apple and other big technology stocks.

<h3>Has Bitcoin Benefited From the Banking Crisis? Not in the Way Its Fans Hoped.</h3>
<sub>By David Yaffe-Bellany</sub>
<p>Bitcoin’s price has soared since banks failed this month, but there’s little evidence that the surge is being driven by investors treating the virtual currency as a financial alternative.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3JZ8ALp"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
