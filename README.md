<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some difficult and tragic events happening in the world. In Morocco, a deadly earthquake struck and left many residence devastated and terrified. In Vietnam, the government is planning to buy Russian weapons, even with US sanctions in place. On the US front, President Donald Trump has been indicted again and was just at a rally where supporters had his mugshot on their T-shirts. There&#39;s also an arms dealer in Ukraine who is making money from the secretive arms market with help from the Pentagon. Elon Musk refused to aid a Ukraine drone strike on a Russian fleet. In sports, we just witnessed 19 year old Coco Gauff become the first American teenager since Serena Williams to make it to the US Open singles final, and she met Aryna Sabalenka there. Finally Daniil Medvedev shocked Carlos Alcaraz in their semifinal to make it to the finals against Novak Djokovic.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
