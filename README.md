<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is experiencing a wide range of news stories across different topics. For example, there are issues with banks as investors doubt their long-term viability, and the Justice Department is increasing their efforts to determine if former President Trump hid documents. In addition, in New York City, people are reacting to the death of a homeless individual on the subway and the lack of an arrest for his death. There are also news stories regarding abortion bans and protection along with stories about pro-Trump individuals who participated in riots at the Capitol. Lastly, &#39;Superfake&#39; handbags have experienced a delirious rise and Justice Thomas did not fully disclose all gifts from a billionaire friend.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
