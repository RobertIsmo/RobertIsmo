<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. International tensions are running high with Russia, China, and Iran backing Hamas against Israel. In the U.S., former President Trump is wrapped up in a legal battle in which his lawyers are attacking the judge&#39;s clerk and jurors have been asked for anonymity to protect them. There was also a shooting last month that left 18 people dead in Lewiston, Maine, which prompted President Biden to pay a visit and offer comfort to those affected by the tragedy. Meanwhile, investors are reassessing their assumptions about the economy and climate change with stocks rallying and clean energy stocks declining. Lastly, there&#39;s an apparent cyberattack that has left libraries across Europe forces to operate without online access, impacting scholars and researchers everywhere.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
