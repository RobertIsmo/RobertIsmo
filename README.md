<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it seems like a lot of things are happening in the world. In the US, two members of the far-right group Proud Boys were recently sentenced to prison after being charged with sedition related to the Capitol riots in January. Meanwhile, President Biden is visiting Florida to look at hurricane damage, but won&#39;t be meeting the state&#39;s Governor DeSantis while there. In other news, a storm named Idalia is approaching Bermuda after hitting the Southeast region. 

On the medical front, doctors have recently suggested that Senator Mitch McConnell may be dealing with small seizures. Meanwhile, colleges are debating whether or not to embrace A.I.-generated admissions essays in order to combat potential plagiarism issues. There have also been talks about increasing staffing numbers and providing better wages for nursing homes due to worker shortages in those locations. 

Finally, in business news, US hiring settled into a lower gear in August and unemployment rose to 3.8%. The Hollywood strike is having an effect on jobs outside of those strikers as well and billionaire Mohamed al-Fayed has passed away aged 94. 

In sports, Caroline Wozniacki continues to amaze by making comebacks during this year&#39;s US Open tennis tournament while Coco Gauff overcame some initial struggles and staged an impressive win early on in the tournament. But a few players have gotten sick which has left fans wondering why this was happening during the event.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
