<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been some tension between Ukraine and Russia recently, with the Ukrainians not backing down from a confrontation. Meanwhile, Putin&#39;s attempt to divide the world&#39;s opinion on Ukraine hasn&#39;t worked, as the West has become unified in their position. In Brazil, there were violent riots recently over the election of Jair Bolsonaro, similar to what happened with Donald Trump&#39;s election in the US. Speaking of the US, there is a new Wall of Remembrance for the Korean War that contains several errors regarding names of those who died in the conflict. The Republican Party in Congress is instituting new rules that may cause divided opinions and gridlock in legislature. René Redzepi, renowned chef from Copenhagen, is closing his highly-regarded restaurant called Noma due to its intense hours and workplace culture. There have been positive developments too–the ozone layer is making a comeback since China has cut rogue emissions, though California is experiencing some devastating storms that have caused power outages and flooding.</p>

<h3>Without Hesitation, Ukraine Goes Toe to Toe With Russia in Bakhmut</h3>
<sub>By Andrew E. Kramer and Nicole Tung</sub>
<p>Earlier in the war, Ukraine’s leadership was more equivocal about pitched battles with high casualties. There’s no second-guessing this time. Some analysts say it makes sense strategically.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Iu7FUe"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>The attack on Brazil’s seat of government resembles the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</h3>
<sub>By Chris Cameron</sub>
<p>Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing former president of Brazil, had for months sought to undermine the results of an election that he lost, in much the same manner that Donald J. Trump did after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ioEyqI"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Republicans Prepare New Rules, but Fixing Congress Isn’t So Easy</h3>

<p>History suggests that the procedural plans of the new House Republican majority are likely to lead to more gridlock and legislative instability, not less.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3IsV8Aq"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
