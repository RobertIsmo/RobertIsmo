<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot has been happening in the world lately. For one thing, there&#39;s been a record surge of people migrating to the United States, driven by crises in Latin America. To try to manage the influx, the US government has recently imposed strict restrictions on who can come into the country. In New York City, officials are busing migrants upstate to other counties, but those counties are mobilizing against it. Meanwhile, with the Covid emergency coming to an end, public health officials are shifting their surveillance efforts to monitoring sewage systems for signs of infection. There&#39;s also been an incredibly sad death toll from Covid in the US- over 1 million people have died from the virus. On a less somber note, Thursday night former president Donald Trump did a contentious town hall on CNN which revealed some of his views on certain policies, including separating migrant children from their parents and potentially pardoning rioters from the Jan 6th insurrection.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
