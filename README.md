<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things have been going through some big changes recently! In the US, there is a lot of conflict coming up around civil rights and equality, with cases of racism and bigotry coming to light. We also have a Navy sailor in jail facing charges for leaking sensitive information. Meanwhile, in New York City, there&#39;s been major success for the outdoor dining industry throughout the pandemic - so much so that it&#39;s now being made permanent but with certain conditions. On a global scale, we are having some extreme weather happening from South America to Europe. 2021 has already set some records for temperatures! There&#39;s definitely a lot going on whether you look at home or around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
