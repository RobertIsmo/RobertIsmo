<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. For instance, tension is increasing among NATO allies as questions over Ukraine&#39;s membership lingers. Turkish president Erdogan is demanding that the EU clear the way for Sweden to join NATO in a surprise move just before their summit. Poland is facing a complicated situation as Ukrainian refugees arrive due to Russia and its war in Ukraine, while also bringing up past trauma from ethnic pogroms. The Southwestern US is also suffering from a heat dome bringing record-breaking temperatures. In Europe this past summer, researchers claim that heat waves killed 61,000 people and strategies to cope with higher temperatures are not keeping up with global warming. Fox&#39;s legal case may be threatened as Tucker Carlson allegedly backed a conspiracy theory about an Arizona man who may sue for defamation. President Biden and King Charles III recently had a meeting, despite hints of tension between their countries, since they share interests and challenges similar to one another. Lastly, NASCAR driver Lawrence G. Nassar was recently stabbed multiple times in prison and Robert Downey Jr. has been promoting his new movie &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; with his transition out of Marvel Studios. Lastly, if it&#39;s too hot outside to cook use these 24 no-cook recipes as an alternative!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
