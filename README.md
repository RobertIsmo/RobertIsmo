<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. President Biden has met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to provide military support to Ukraine, and there is a lot of discussion about what would happen if Russia was held responsible for any war crimes committed over the past year. In Southern California, there has been days of snowfall trapping people, and a murderer was sentenced to life in prison after lying to the judge. Democrat Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has ambitions, but has said that they don’t include the White House currently. People are also clamoring for action on child migrant labor and Jessica Steinrock does work to make sure that scenes with intimacy in film are done correctly and safely. Additionally, a Medal of Honor for Paris Davis was recently awarded and there&#39;s a study looking into the genetic effects of radiation from Chernobyl on stray dogs. Finally, Dasha Zhukova’s artful rise has come up against Putin&#39;s war.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
