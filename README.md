<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the UK, Microsoft&#39;s $69 billion bid to acquire Activision was stopped by the British antitrust watchdog, which is viewed as a major victory for those pushing for more regulation of tech giants. Over in Poland, a town that used to be occupied by the Soviets has decided to ditch their military re-enactments and Lenin banners. On the political front, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is facing a terrorism case that he says is &quot;absurd&quot; and could land him in jail for life. South Korea&#39;s President Yoon Suk Yeol just visited the United States and he and President Biden agreed to cooperate on nuclear weapons. In the US, House Republicans are trying to pass a fiscal plan that ties a yearlong debt ceiling increase to spending cuts and policy changes while trying to rebrand their plan as something other than &quot;cuts.&quot; Meanwhile, lawmakers are looking at how banning TikTok would affect users across the country. Finally, Bud Light got into an ad flap with a transgender influencer that put them &quot;in the center of the culture wars in a way that no company could possibly want to be.&quot; As for President Biden&#39;s 2024 campaign plans - we&#39;ll have to stay tuned on that one!</p>

<h3>After a Hellish Start and a Honeymoon, McCarthy Faces His First Big Test</h3>

<h3>Don’t Call It a ‘Cut’: G.O.P. Tries to Rebrand Its Plan to Reduce Spending</h3>

<p>House Republicans pitched their 2011 debt limit bill aggressively, trumpeting a zeal for deep spending cuts.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
