<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, four members of Russia&#39;s National Guard have been charged with war crimes after they allegedly acted with impunity without attempting to conceal their identities. We also know more details about an attempted drone attack on Moscow that the Russian Defense Ministry reported last month. 

In terms of business, we&#39;re seeing prices go up as companies try to protect their profits and increase inflation. Meanwhile, food prices are comparatively high in Europe due to many factors like agricultural and energy costs that haven&#39;t decreased enough. 

The U.S. is bracing for a key committee assessment of a potential debt limit deal that would include $136 billion of cuts, some of which would come from extra work requirements for food stamps and cuts to IRS funding. 

We&#39;re also learning more about A.I., as industry leaders warn that these systems could be just as dangerous as pandemics or nuclear weapons. Additionally, researchers are looking for ways to make A.I.&#39;s sound more &quot;human,&quot; by teaching fewer words to large language models. 

Plus, scientists are developing a genetic test to help patients figure out whether they need early treatment for heart disease. Lastly, we are seeing how influential conservative religious women were in Turkish President Erdogan&#39;s recent victory and success in office.</p>

<h3>A Pillar of Erdogan’s Victory: Devout Conservative Women</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
