<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the United States, news reports have been covering the aftermath of the January 6 Capitol riot. Several leaders from far-right groups who helped instigate it have received long prison sentences. Attention is now turning toward the difficult process of prosecuting former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence has criticized Trump&#39;s populism in a speech in New Hampshire and Justice Department plans to indict Hunter Biden on a gun charge this month. 

In Mexico, the Supreme Court has issued an historic ruling decriminalizing abortion nationwide, women competed for the presidency for the first time ever, and exports have been declining. Meanwhile in China, car makers are having success with overseas sales as other exports are faltering. 

On a lighter note, temperatures at the US Open tennis tournament have been very high with some players saying they perform better in warmer weather.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
