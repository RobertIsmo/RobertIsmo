<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. Ukraine&#39;s President Zelensky is visiting Japan, and people are concerned of pressure to send weapons. Biden just reversed course on Ukraine&#39;s request for F-16s and there is a G7 Summit with many unpopular leaders. Zelensky also paid a visit to India, whose stance on the war is complicating things for the West. In Ukraine itself, there has been a lot of conflict in the city of Bakhmut, which the founder of Wagner claims has been captured, but Ukraine denies that claim. Meanwhile in the US, questions are surfacing about Governor DeSantis&#39; use of private jets, and climate change is making it difficult for people who rely on rice as their main food source. Additionally, inflation has been surprisingly persistent despite changes in the economy, mostly due to car prices. On top of all that, Jim Brown—an iconic athlete with a complicated reputation—recently passed away and it&#39;s opened up reflections over athletes adopting social beliefs. Lastly, Senator Dianne Feinstein&#39;s health complications have fatefully raised questions of whether Governor Newsom will keep his promise to appoint a Black woman if Feinstein leaves her seat.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
