<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of tensions happening in the world right now related to Israel and the Middle East. U.S. President Biden has found it impossible to take even modest steps towards a peaceful resolution between Israel and Palestine. This has caused fear for Jews in Europe, as there has been a recent surge of antisemitic acts and a Hamas assault on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran is facing a dilemma over whether to live up to their fiery rhetoric about destroying Israel, while Israel is aiming to crush Iran&#39;s ally Hamas. 

In the U.S., Republicans are pointing to anti-Israel protests at college campuses as part of a &quot;woke agenda&quot; in the larger cultural battle over education. In terms of business-related news, U.S. job openings were steady in September despite the highest interest rates in two decades, but an offshore wind firm cancelled some New Jersey projects due to high financing costs. 

On the legal front, if Trump wins the election, his allies want lawyers who will bless a more radical agenda than before -- they are planning to install more aggressive legal gatekeepers if he regains power. As for culture, we have Five Minutes That Will Make You Love Thelonious Monk by Jon Batiste and others! Lastly, Ukraine&#39;s president Volodymyr Zelensky is feeling frustrated that his troops&#39; achievements against Russia are being underestimated by U.S. officials while people in one town grapple with an invasion that began with an ongoing cat-and-mouse game of collaboration and resistance.</p>
