<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The economy seems to be improving across the US, with some strong data suggesting a boost to President Biden&#39;s term. There is an ongoing and tightly contested presidential race, with a Times&#x2F;Siena poll showing Biden and Trump are tied. A SuperPAC backing Governor DeSantis has burned through $34 million already without a positive outcome. Former President Donald J. Trump&#39;s political action committee is nearly broke due to paying legal bills for Trump and his associates while trying to fend off numerous investigations. Interestingly, Donald J. Trump has indicated he will not attend the first Republican debate in August. In Europe, Ukraine&#39;s grain companies have been facing threats posed by Russia after the collapse of a Black Sea grain deal. Joe Petrsoric, a longtime bartender at Broadway&#39;s go-to saloon, is retiring after memorizing the favorite drinks of all the top stars visiting his bar. The US Women&#39;s Soccer Team had a close call against Portugal in the World Cup, but they pulled off a win in the end which keeps their dreams of winning the World Cup alive. Museum entry fees everywhere continue to rise as buildings expand and attendance slows. Portland held an experiment to curb overdose rates by decriminalizing small amounts of illicit drugs, which is entering its third year now. An investigation is underway into Senator Menendez and his new wife, Nadine Menendez, over possibility that they received undisclosed gifts from her old friends. Finally, family of Henrietta Lacks has finally settled with Thermo Fisher Scientific over profiting from her cells without seeking permission from her family members.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
