<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things in the world are pretty tense when it comes to international relations. China has been refusing to restart high-level talks with the United States, for instance, and the situation could potentially escalate in contested areas such as the Taiwan Strait. Meanwhile, Israel&#39;s right-wing government is causing difficulty for some Jewish Democrats. Their traditional defense of Israel often hinged on shared democratic values, but now that&#39;s proving tougher.

In the US, the Republican party recent losses under Donald Trump has Republican governors talking election strategy for 2024, while two separate shootings involving wrong turns were reported in different parts this week. Meanwhile in Ukraine, social media stars are rethinking how they use their influence after years of Russian dominating their mediums.

In Sudan, US troops are currently readying for evactuation of the American embassy as fighting intensifes, with civilians caught in the midst of it. Back home in the US, MyPillow founder Mike Lindell is being forced to pay up after arranging an ill-fated contest offering $5 million if someone could &#39;prove him wrong&#39; concerning false election claims. Finally, a track by two AIs posing as Drake and The Weeknd has gone viral and been removed from streaming services, raising important legal and creative questions about what defines &#39;real music&#39; going forward.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
