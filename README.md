<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has initiated an all-out war after avoiding open-ended military engagements and peace initiatives for 15 years. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden is facing challenges in terms of politics and security as he plans to visit Israel. On the global stage, Vladimir Putin of Russia is visiting China to strengthen economic ties while Chinese Prime Minister Xu Jinping is rethinking his signature aid initiative. Poland has officially voted for a significant change and Jordan is attempting to become the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, though remains without one due to holdouts from the Republican Party. In terms of health, scientists are offering a new explanation for why some people get long Covid and in France a teacher was recently killed which has heightened anxiety about terrorism. Finally, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett is calling for Supreme Court ethics rules to promote more public transparency.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
