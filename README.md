<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, Turkey is voting in a tough election for their president. In the hardest-hit parts of their quake zone, voters are looking for a change. In Ukraine, they are making small gains to take over Bakhmut, which is a heavily damaged city controlled by Russia. The Ukrainian president recently visited Germany and thanked the leaders there for standing with his country. Meanwhile in Kenya, hundreds of people have been drawn out to an extreme wilderness area led by a preacher preaching the end times. 

In the US, there was a group that raised millions in small donations but it ended up going to the firms making the robocalls and political operatives instead of being used to promote issues and candidates. Some are already looking ahead to the 2024 presidential race, which looks like it will be full of flawed standard-bearers and unhappy voters. Fort Benning recently changed its name to Fort Moore, honoring a military spouse and mother; this is now the only U.S base with this kind of name. Meanwhile there&#39;s also another huge wealth transfer occurring in America where trillions of dollars are going to heirs- this will likely just reinforce inequality. 

Lastly, MTV News is shutting down after bridging the gap between news and pop culture for a generation; people are reflecting on its legacy. Along with that there&#39;s a large number of homeless people in San Diego who are at risk due to a lack of help from Congress in trying to fix immigration dysfunction- they&#39;ve failed at initiatives multiple times now due to politics and disagreements.</p>

<h3>As Ukraine Makes Inroads in Bakhmut, Devastation Still Reigns</h3>

<h3>How to Raise $89 Million in Small Donations — And Make It Disappear</h3>
<sub>By David A. Fahrenthold, Tiff Fehr and Charlie Smart</sub>
<p>A group of conservative operatives using sophisticated robocalls raised millions of dollars from donors using pro-police and pro-veteran messages. But instead of using the money to promote issues and candidates, an analysis by The New York Times shows, nearly all the money went to pay the firms making the calls and the operatives themselves.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/42RRXZP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
