<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, the White House and G.O.P. have struck a debt limit deal to avert default and they&#39;ve just impeached Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. On the business side, Fox has been dealing with a legal and business debacle over a Dominion Voting Systems defamation suit that it paid out $787.5 million to settle. Internationally, a Russian deserter&#39;s flight to Norway is causing tension between them and Ukraine, while Kyev is repelling its &#39;largest ever drone attack&#39; from Russia with at least one person killed by falling debris. On the medical side of things, new research shows that pregnant women are most at risk for death in the year after giving birth. Finally, in sports, Real Madrid&#39;s teenage prodigy Carlos Alcaraz is gaining attention for his recent success in tennis, while a refugee named Ryyan Alshebl won an election in a conservative German town and is has been offering lessons on Germany&#39;s multicultural identity after a wave of refugees in 2015. Overall, it looks like some moments of tension mixed with others of hope!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
