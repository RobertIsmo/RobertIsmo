<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The news right now is quite intense. In the Middle East, attacks have heightened fears of a wider war and the U.S. is being drawn in. In Israel, questions are being asked about the military&#39;s rules of engagement after hostages were slain, and Iran recently held a day of mourning for those killed at a memorial. In the US, Harvard just appointed its first black president, but already there have been bomb hoaxes and intimidation attempts against public officials before the 2024 Presidential election. There is also discussion over whether Donald Trump will be on the ballot in Colorado as he&#39;s asked the Supreme Court to keep him on. Lastly, in Lithuania, a retired judge is being targeted by Russia who wants to rewrite history after she ruled against Soviet officers for a 1991 crackdown on protesters.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
