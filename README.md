<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Businesses and banks of all sizes across the U.S. are struggling due to concerns about a larger financial crisis. Many banks have collapsed recently, and it&#39;s sparked debate over regulations for midsize banks. Additionally, the tech industry is being tested and the government has taken dramatic steps to help shore up the banking system. On top of that, Russia has been escalating tensions in Ukraine and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump are clashing over foreign policy. Out of all these topics, President Biden just announced a landmark submarine deal with Australia and Britain, while also taking contradictory positions on a huge oil project in Alaska. And on top of all that, A24 achieved great success at the Oscars this year!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
