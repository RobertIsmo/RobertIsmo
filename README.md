<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy week! In the US, the Republican party is having difficulties as they struggle over who should be their speaker. Meanwhile, Biden is trying to promote bipartisanship and bridge the divide between parties. On the sports front, NFL players are returning to work despite heavy hearts following an injury to a player. Elsewhere, Putin has warned his people that a long fight lies ahead and salesforce has announced layoffs due to business slowdowns in the tech sector. Finally, Tesla has had a huge sell-off and Coinbase has just reached a $100 million settlement with New York regulators.</p>

<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
