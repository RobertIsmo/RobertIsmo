<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is happening in the world right now. There&#39;s an increase in holiday spending, despite predictions of a decline. On Wall Street, analysts are split as to whether or not we&#39;re headed into a downturn. In Israel, citizens are still coming to terms with a brutal attack by Hamas which left them traumatized. Meanwhile, nearly two million people have been displaced in Gaza due to intensifying fighting, and there were U.S. airstrikes targeting Iran-backed groups in Iraq after an attack on an American base injured three service members. On top of that, New York City has grappled with 150,000 migrant arrivals in less than two years creating chaos and confusion--and Ukraine has attacked Russian warships in Crimea while an opposition leader is ironically transferred to an Arctic prison in Russia. Closer to home, Donald Trump is proposing new taxes on imports and a split from China as part of his 2025 trade agenda for if he returns to office. Whatever the outcome, it looks like Trump will be attempting an even more extreme agenda than his first term if he wins. Finally, one Mexico City neighborhood still loves and cherishes the Volkswagen Beetle!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
