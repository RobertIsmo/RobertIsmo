<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of chaos happening in the US, especially in the House of Representatives. An Ohio congressman has been pushing for a third vote to name a speaker, while some have been discussing giving power to an interim speaker instead. 

President Biden made a visit to Israel, and promised backing in the war against Hamas, but also signaled his intention to limit their actions. There has also been an alarming death toll from a hospital blast in Gaza. 

The Trump legal team&#39;s Sidney Powell has pleaded guilty in Georgia&#39;s election interference case, while other members of politics have decided not to run for office. The FCC is on the verge of restoring Net Neutrality rules which were stricken during the Trump administration. 

Closer to home, the murder case of the Gilgo Beach Killer has finally been solved after 13 years and Britney Spears has just released her memoir which is full of hope despite her struggles with fame and conservatorship. Finally, T Magazine&#39;s upcoming Greats issue will be honoring four talented individuals across music, film, art and fashion.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
