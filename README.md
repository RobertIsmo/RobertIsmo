<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now it looks like there is a lot happening in the world that is concerning. In the U.S., there is an agreement between Canada and the U.S. to reduce migration, and investigations into former President Trump that could have serious implications for justice. On top of that, banks are borrowing more from the Federal Reserve as economic turmoil swells while stocks remain turbulent awaiting their next move. Finally, tensions have been escalating over ties between TikTok&#39;s CEO and China and the potential ban of the app by President Biden. It&#39;s a lot of news, but we can only wait and see how things evolve.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
