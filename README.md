<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are several stories coming out of the US and around the world right now. In the US, Donald Trump is looking to run for a second term and his administration is getting more sophisticated and less bound by checks and balances. In North Dakota, Governor Doug Burgum has ended his White House run after failing to gain traction with his focus on economic and foreign policy. On the international stage, there has been a militant rocket attack on an Israeli military base that may have housed nuclear missiles. There have also been allegations of sexual violence during the attacks on Israel, maps tracking the war efforts in Israel and Gaza, and a Supreme Court case regarding opioid settlements for Purdue Pharma. Lastly, there is an update on the best theater in 2023, warnings from the White House about running out of funding for weapons toward Ukraine, and a report from Russia about convicts joining the war effort there. Closer to home, there is an investigation into gender and racial discrimination in New Jersey state police forces, and a promising study in California schools using targeted investment for pandemic recovery.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
