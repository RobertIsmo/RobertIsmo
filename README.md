<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, proud boys lieutenant Joseph Biggs has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for sedition in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, and former President Trump has pleaded not guilty in a Georgia election interference case. In addition, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has released a letter declaring him medically clear to work after a medical episode. Meanwhile, &#39;Three Johns&#39; are the top potential successors to McConnell should he be forced to resign for health reasons. 

In international news, Ukraine is pushing ahead with their offensive against Russian forces after recapturing a village and new Russian high school textbooks have been released that seek to justify the war in Ukraine. In Africa, South Africa is dealing with the scandal and fallout from the British Museum as well as an illegally occupied derelict building firetrap that tragically claimed lives in Johannesburg. 

In the art world, Investigators have seized a &#39;Marcus Aurelius&#39; statue from Cleveland Museum, Christie&#39;s cancelled a sale of jewelry connected to a Nazi-era fortune due to backlash from Jewish organizations, and former Goldman Sachs trader has apparently started a venture backed by some of Silicon Valley&#39;s wealthiest people to build a California city from scratch.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
