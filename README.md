<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In Israel and Gaza, a conflict has recently broken out between Israeli soldiers and Hamas leading to the deaths of hostages and many members of a single family. Meanwhile in Russia, President Putin is taking advantage of a Western boycott for financial gain. Hungary has also been making headlines, undermining Europe&#39;s aid package for Ukraine. Here in the US, Florida Governor DeSantis&#39;s super PAC is losing leaders and the Florida Republican Party recently stripped powers from their chairman due to a criminal investigation. Additionally, conservative Moms for Liberty have been under scrutiny amidst sex scandals. The issue of abortion rights has also arisen, calling into question what will happen post-Roe v. Wade. Finally, universities across the country have been cracking down on pro-Palestinian speech due to pressure about alleged anti-semitism.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
