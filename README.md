<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening around the world right now. In the US, Governor Abbott is pushing the limits of state power by policing the Texas border using razor wire, floating barriers and state troopers to deter unauthorized migration. A federal judge has also blocked a new asylum policy proposed by the Biden Administration that was intended to limit who can apply for asylum in the US. 

In other news, Russia has launched attacks in Ukraine while an internet troll tied to the Kremlin has fallen from power. On the Korean peninsula there&#39;s been no fighting for 70 years since the Korean War Armistice was signed, but life still remains unchanged across the DMZ. Meanwhile, former First Lady Melania Trump has mostly retreated from public view while her husband Donald Trump faces increasing legal peril and ads feature Iowans who are distancing themselves from their MAGA hats.

Separately, a first-term US Congressman in New York stands accused of using his political connections to fuel get-rich schemes. The US Midwest is also enduring extreme weather with blistering heat driving wildfires and smoke as well as two continental battles with fires throughout southern Europe and North Africa. Lastly, credit markets are creaking causing economic uncertainty while markets eagerly await the Fed’s July meeting and any commitments regarding raising interest rates.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
