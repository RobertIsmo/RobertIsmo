<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on the world right now. The US Supreme Court has adopted an ethics code for its justices in response to some questionable deals and gifts being disclosed. Congress has seen some of its aides break with their bosses over their views on the Israel-Hamas war. House Democrats have recently censured one of their members Rashida Tlaib, while in Israel, more than 125,000 people have been evacuated from their communities due to border attacks. In the US, Federal Prosecutors objected to a request from Trump to have an election trial broadcast. Donald Trump Jr. defended his father at court which was found to be inflating their series values. In Britain, Rishi Sunak, Prime Minister attempted a reset by swaying more towards the center politically but chose someone from a troubled past to fill the Foreign Secretary position. Research shows that trees can significantly fight climate change but need other methods to assist it as well. Lastly, Netflix&#39;s show &#39;The Crown&#39; is doing its final season focusing on the beloved Princess Diana&#39;s death in 1997.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
