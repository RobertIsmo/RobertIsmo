<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the U.S., White House officials are warning Congress to increase aid to Ukraine amid waning Republican support. Elsewhere, nearly 200 inmates left a high-security Russian prison to join the war in Ukraine, and an American reporter is still being held in Russia after 250 days awaiting trial on a spying charge. At the U.N., accounts of sexual violence by Hamas were aired and Vice President Kamala Harris took a forceful tone with Israel regarding Middle East Diplomacy. Meanwhile, the U.S. is mulling over a task force to protect ships in the Red Sea from Iranian proxy forces, and Republican politicians are asking Chris Christie to drop out of his presidential campaign. Additionally, a Super PAC is spending over $10 million for ballot access for Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39;s independent presidential candidacy, while the Supreme Court appears split over an opioid settlement for Purdue Pharma. To finish off on a lighter note, the theater industry had some notable plays and musicals this year!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
