<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is going through some dramatic changes. In the US, the schools are trying to adapt to new rules on gender, bathrooms and pronouns. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to stop Donald Trump with a lot of pageantry at the Iowa State Fair, but he&#39;s not budging. 

Internationally, there was a tragic assassination of a presidential candidate in Ecuador who was vocal about ties between the state and organized crime. There&#39;s also been rising uncertainty for food prices due to heat, war and trade protections. Moreover, Ukraine has sent drones into Russian-occupied territory to survey the battle front, revealing images of craters and charred armor. And finally, one of Russia&#39;s most prominent tech figures has called their war in Ukraine &#39;barbaric.&#39;</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
