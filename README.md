<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. In the US, House Republicans are pushing to pass a fiscal plan while Speaker Kevin McCarthy attempts to navigate divisions between members. Meanwhile, UK regulators have blocked a big tech acquisition between Microsoft and Activision. Internationally, Alexei Navalny, a Russian opposition leader, is facing terrorism charges that could land him in jail for life, while Pope Francis has granted women a vote in an influential meeting of Bishops. Finally, tensions are mounting between Disney and Florida&#39;s Governor Ron DeSantis over business regulations and Bud Light is facing criticism due to a marketing flap.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
