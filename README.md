<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension between Israel and Hamas that&#39;s been going on for a while, and negotiations are in the works for a cease-fire. Meanwhile, in the tech world, Sam Altman is back as the CEO of OpenAI but it wasn&#39;t smooth sailing to get there. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao just pled guilty to money laundering violations, too. On the US front, Democrats are trying to draw attention to Donald Trump even though he&#39;s been relatively quiet since leaving office. The Colorado Supreme Court also recently heard a case related to Trump&#39;s 14th Amendment rights. In AI news, nations are debating whether there should be legal limits for killer drones controlled by machines. Plus, The New York Times Book Review just released their list of 100 Notable Books from 2023! Finally, scientists have been studying the Omicron variant of Covid-19 which has proven both incredibly infectious and an evolutionary marvel.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
