<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To my close friend:
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. The Chinese spy agency is rising to challenge the CIA, and is using advanced technology as part of their efforts. In Israel, there is skepticism growing about the ability of the government to dismantle Hamas after a particularly brutal attack in October. Ukraine has an issue with thousands of children being separated from their parents due to Russian authorities in the early stages of war. Additionally, India&#39;s foreign minister is in Moscow to reinforce economic and defense ties despite external pressure.

On a lighter note, The New York Times is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for use of its copyrighted work for training chatbots. There are also some interesting stories about people collecting unexpected treasures or making a big life change and moving to an island! 
Unfortunately, Mexico&#39;s president called for more U.S. support ahead of a meeting which comes as border crossings have reached record numbers and as a migrant caravan heads towards the U.S. Additionally, there were 3,500 migrant families in New York City receiving eviction notices last week which will affect children changing schools or facing long commutes to school.

Finally, we lost beloved actor Lee Sun-kyun from &quot;Parasite,&quot; along with one half of the Smothers Brothers duo Tom Smothers who was a driving force behind their groundbreaking TV show. 
It&#39;s been quite a week and definitely a lot going on in our world!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
