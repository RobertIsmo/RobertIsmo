<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, there has been conflict between Hamas and the Israeli military. There has been a massacre in which many people had to take refuge in their homes for 5 hours before help arrived. In Gaza, hospitals are running short of fuel and beds due to the number of wounded people from airstrikes. 

Also, Republicans have chosen Steve Scalise as their new speaker nominee for the House of Representatives, but the election has been postponed due to internal divisions in the party. Additionally, Social Security benefits will increase by 3.2% in 2024 and it looks like the Federal Reserve may be done raising interest rates, which could cool economic growth. 

Finally, former president Trump faces a slew of legal troubles with his lawyers arguing over the timing of his federal trials. There are also fundraisers underway to cover the legal expenses for some individuals who were involved with prosecuting him.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
