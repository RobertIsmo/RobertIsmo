<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening right now in the world, especially in the US. The Congressional Budget Office released a report saying that the US is projected to add $19 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. There&#39;s been a big partisan fight over how to manage US fiscal policy. The nonpartisan budget office also warned of a possible default between July and September if tax receipts come up short and Congress fails to act on the debt limit.

Social Security spending is rising fast, as an aging population starts claiming benefits. Joe Biden&#39;s nominee for IRS commissioner was recently grilled about his $80 billion plan for modernizing the agency. In Russia, there&#39;s a growing number of casualties from the Wagner mercenary forces - showing the huge losses that are being suffered in its invasion. This has raised questions about whether Russia can sustain its offensive. 

Closer to home, there was an emotional hearing where a gunman from Buffalo was sentenced to life in prison. Scientists also got a close-up look beneath an Antarctic ice shelf which will help with forecasting how sea levels could be impacted by melting ice. 

On the lighter side, silver-screen sex symbol Raquel Welch recently passed away at age 82 and chefs in New Orleans are exploring how West African and Caribbean cuisines have had as much influence on Creole cooking as previously thought.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
