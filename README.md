<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things are very divided in the United States. Black voters appear to be moving away from supporting Biden, but many strategists say that this shift could threaten his chances of re-election. Meanwhile, Trump hasn&#39;t been indicted by the courts yet, but if he were convicted that could have a major effect on 2024&#39;s election. Also, some Democrats are suggesting that Biden should be replaced by a prominent Democrat as the primary nominee, but it looks unlikely for now. 

Outside of the US, in Gaza hospitals are facing extreme shortages of medicine and resources due to recent bombings and sieges by Israel. Plus, debates over power and how different people&#39;s suffering is recognized are occurring within the echo chamber.

Finally, there are some interesting issues closer to home. Private companies offering exclusive high-end services for New Yorkers, a hedge fund run by warring billionaires going through a rough period, and  a man from Texas challenging gun rights protections in the Supreme Court all contribute to an abnormal everyday life right now.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
