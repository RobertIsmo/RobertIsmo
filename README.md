<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now, from protests and political turmoil to pandemics and crime. In the US, there has been news recently about police brutality, with five officers being charged with the murder of a young Black man, Tyre Nichols. This has sparked complex conversations about race and policing. On top of this, US officials are now moving faster after accusations of beatings and speaking critically about police violence due to cameras everywhere and wary citizens. 

At the same time, a drug company was found making billions by gaming the US patent systems, creating monopolies at the expense of patients and taxpayers. Overseas, there is a lot of unrest in Israel due to its far-right government raising tensions, as well as aggressive attacks on strategic supply routes in Eastern Ukraine. In the former president&#39;s case, he&#39;s trying out more extreme rhetoric via social media with QAnon accounts and small-scale traditional campaign tactics for his White House bid. And while we’re still dealing with possible manipulation by an oligarch who could have recruited an FBI agent to investigate him, there is also some good news – like films projects at Sundance showing complex relationships and inspiring documentaries about artists.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
