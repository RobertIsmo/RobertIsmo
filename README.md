<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>The world is going through a period of transition right now as governments around the world are dealing with the aftermath of the pandemic. In China, college graduates are facing bleak job prospects so schools are under pressure from Beijing to secure jobs for them. Meanwhile, Taiwan is using its cuisine to shape a distinct culture to differentiate itself from China. In the U.S., Congress&#39;s punishments have become politicized and normalized and Republican contenders are feeding into voter distrust in courts, schools and the military. Former President Trump also recently taunted the U.S. women&#39;s soccer team for their loss on the global stage. Further afield, military tensions have risen in Ukraine&#39;s Black Sea region, prompting the U.A.E., a wealthy ally of the U.S., to diverge from American foreign policy towards Russia and China. In Ohio, citizens will be voting on whether to amend the state constitution in an important abortion rights referendum while Ireland is mourning the death of singer Sinéad O&#39;Connor. Finally, Zoom has surprisingly decided that it wants its employees back in the office while scientists are busy teaching chimpanzees to seek safety during storms!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
