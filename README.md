<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Israel and Gaza, there have been airstrikes and ground fighting, and some videos show the beginning of an attack on a music festival in southern Israel. Russia&#39;s President Putin has offered a muted response to attacks on Israel, likely because of the growing tensions between the two countries due to war in Ukraine. Additionally, the fragile global economy is facing a crisis as a result of this war, making it harder to contain inflation. In the US, Robert Hur—the special counsel appointed to investigate how sensitive material ended up at President Biden&#39;s house and office—interviewed him. Meanwhile, Republicans are preparing to select a new speaker after McCarthy&#39;s ouster and Kamala Harris is trying to make her case for herself after nearly three years. Lastly, it appears that US schools under Defense Department authority are outperforming public schools.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
