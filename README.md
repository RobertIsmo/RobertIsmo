<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. The Biden administration is proposing rules that would give schools flexibility to decide how to handle transgender athletes, with safety and fairness being taken into account. The Supreme Court also recently ruled in favor of a transgender girl who had been banned from playing on the girls&#39; track team, and the US acknowledged that their evacuation from Afghanistan should have started sooner than it did. In Tennessee, a Democratic state lawmaker was expelled from the House based on accusations of misconduct. 

Meanwhile, there was a school shooting in Nashville recently that has people questioning the city&#39;s current divisions between left and right, urban and rural, and state and city. The IRS is also coming out with an $80 billion plan to overhaul tax collection. There has been some discussion about tighter rules for ethics after revelations about Clarence Thomas&#39;s undisclosed vacations with a real estate billionaire. And Russia has launched an offensive ran aground after its ambitions never really went anywhere. 

On top of all this, Donald Trump was just arraigned on criminal charges earlier this week. It&#39;s lifted up a campaign of Yusef Salaam, one of the wrongly imprisoned Central Park Five, who called it “karma” from the former president.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
