<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, China recently released a position paper that calls for an end to the fighting in the war, but avoids making any demands that could hurt its relationship with Russia. There have been many long-term ripple effects of the war, ranging from disrupted lives and economies to a shift in the global order. On the topic of natural disasters, California has been hit by a blizzard causing major traffic disruption. It was both damaging and surprisingly beautiful, leading some residents to come out and marvel at it. The Federal Reserve’s recent inflation readings have defied expectations and been staying power despite being down from their peak last summer. Another development in the US is Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, who is facing a test as he responds to a train derailment and its aftermath in East Palestine. Closer to home, there&#39;s a fascinating war going down between two tiny New York City newspapers — complete with a crusty publisher and &quot;guerilla&quot; litigator! Finally, there&#39;s an interesting new reality show in Holland where amateur and professional artists are competing to recreate some of Vermeer&#39;s lost works coinciding with a big exhibition of his art. In terms of opinion, Marjorie Taylor Greene has proposed a “national divorce” plan that reveals her ambitions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
