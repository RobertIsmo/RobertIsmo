<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, there has been a counteroffensive against Russian defenses that has made progress, but there are still challenges ahead. In the US, Republicans have accused Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland of misleading Congress about the Hunter Biden investigation. US gas prices are at their highest in 11 months, which has implications on the Federal Reserve&#39;s rates. Biden is also meeting with Netanyahu after snubbing him earlier this year, while the White House is planning to create an &quot;American Climate Corps&quot; to train young people for green jobs to combat climate change. There&#39;s also a discussion about how much patients should be told about potentially risky treatments. In Morocco, a stretch of road across the Atlas mountains has become a lifeline for villages that were destroyed in an earthquake recently. Meanwhile in Iowa, Donald Trump is returning and his rivals are seeing this as their best chance to score against him politically. Lastly, interesting research suggests animals may be able to communicate using some form of language!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
