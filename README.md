<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is going on in the world right now! In the US, there&#39;s a hearing involving Trump documents that could set off a long legal fight. In addition, the Georgia Supreme Court just blocked an investigation into potential election interference by Trump and his allies. Meanwhile, temperatures are reaching record highs in parts of the country. 
The heat index is also dangerously high in the Middle East right now, but that hasn&#39;t abated European tourists visiting various parts of the continent. The current war in Ukraine is also intensifying as World War II artifacts become a battlefield of ideologies. In Israel, protesters are pushing against potential legal changes proposed by Prime Minister Netanyahu, while President Biden will be meeting with Israeli President Isaac Herzog soon to counter rising tension between the US and Netanyahu&#39;s administration. 
Lastly, A.I. is being both embraced and warily regarded by advertisers who recognize its potential to improve their ads, but worry it may disrupt their industry further. There&#39;s also an open debate about how ChatGPT technology will use images to make decisions - something that&#39;s too advanced for the public to access currently.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
