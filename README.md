<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In New York City, there is a growing income gap between the rich and everyone else, and migrants from all over the world have been settling in the city. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a legal battle over pay standards for food delivery workers in the city, while President Donald Trump&#39;s legal defense team is facing strain as they defend him against prosecution. There is also potential for government shutdown in the U.S. due to lack of funds and disagreements between Republicans and Democrats on a temporary measure to fund the government. This could delay data on unemployment and inflation, potentially causing a recession. The Republicans held a recently debate, with Governor Ron DeSerialis of Florida trying to gain momentum with his opinion on President Trump, while elsewhere in Israel there has been tension as Jewish people argued over prayer rights on their holiest day of Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
