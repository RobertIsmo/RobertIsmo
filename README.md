<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are really interesting and varied in the world right now. On the political front, there&#39;s a huge story about Vladimir Putin and Russia&#39;s involvement in what has become a catastrophe for them. When it comes to climate change, some experts think it&#39;s time to mark a new epoch in geologic time due to its huge impact on Planet Earth. There&#39;s also a lot of news about business, specifically focused on FTX, which is an exchange platform that does things differently than traditional stock exchanges. Sports-wise, there&#39;s been lots of focus on the World Cup and one of its stars Lionel Messi. For something more local, residents of San Francisco are trying to figure out what&#39;s next for their downtown, which has been particularly empty lately. We&#39;re also remembering some children who lost their lives due to gun violence in 2021, and citizens in New York are deploying creative tactics to catch people caught cheating or damaging license plates. Finally, we’re getting excited for 2022 with predictions on top restaurants dishes, famous faces of the year, and the NFL playoff picture!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
