<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot happening in the world recently! President Biden is introducing a student loan forgiveness plan that would mean millions of people&#39;s student loan balances could be reduced by up to $20,000. In Europe, militaries have been struggling to find tanks for Ukraine to use against Russian forces. Meanwhile, China welcomed the Belarusian leader and is accused of sending arms and ammunition to Russia for use in its war on Ukraine. Over in Britain, the king had a tea with an E.U. leader that has many people concerned about the implications of mixing politics and monarchy. Elon Musk&#39;s repeated job cuts have led to new fears that Twitter won&#39;t get the help it needs to triage outages. Here in the US, a prominent lawyer went from working with Trump&#39;s team to representing Hunter Biden as he faces scrutiny over taxes. And here in Chicago, the mayoral election is being closely watched since cities all around America face similar problems like crime and problems related to the pandemic. On top of all that, 23 dead whales have been found along the East Coast since December!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
