<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot going on in the world. In Ukraine, a dam has been split in half and thousands of people are being evacuated due to rising water levels. The British Royal Family is also in the news right now; Prince Harry is taking the press to court for years of phone hacking. Additionally, movie theaters around the world are spending millions of dollars in upgrades to try and draw people back. In France, some of the famous beaches of D-Day are facing an onslaught from rising seas due to climate change. Lastly, Apple is making a bold bet that it can redefine the virtual reality space with their new $3,500 goggles.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
