<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening internationally right now. In the Gaza Strip, airstrikes have caused death and immense suffering to local residents. In Iran, there is a dilemma related to its long-standing vow to destroy Israel. Protests are erupting in the US, both in support of and opposition to violent strikes against Israel. In sports news, legendary basketball coach Bobby Knight has died. He was renowned for his championships and also for his temperamental outbursts. Offshore wind projects in New Jersey have been canceled due to financial constraints, while controversy continues around former President Trump&#39;s potential 14th Amendment disqualification trial. A judge has hinted at delaying the trial scheduled for May, allowing more time for documents to be reviewed.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
