<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is going on in the world right now. Israel&#39;s Supreme Court has just struck down a move to curb its powers, and South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung was recently stabbed. Hundreds of migrants have been dropped off in New Jersey to avoid New York rules, and Japan was hit by a powerful earthquake. Trump is making an ambitious argument for &quot;absolute immunity&quot; after his acquittal in his second impeachment trial, and Peter Magubane, who fought apartheid with his camera, passed away. On a less serious note, people are making cooking resolutions and locking in high interest rates for their savings accounts.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
