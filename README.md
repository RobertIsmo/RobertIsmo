<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like former President Donald Trump is going to get indicted soon and the Republican party is debating how to respond, with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently speaking out against the Manhattan District Attorney&#39;s handling of the case. In other news, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are celebrating their countries&#39; strong ties together despite Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine. At home, there is unrest in Los Angeles where school employees are threatening to strike over pay disputes, and Fox News is facing a huge lawsuit due to allegations of misogyny and discrimination at the company. Lastly, we are beginning to see signs of a new era in women&#39;s college basketball where teams like Ole Miss appear to be defying the usual powerhouses such as Stanford. Finally, despite ongoing debate over his decision to get involved in the Iraq War, former US President George W. Bush has not wavered from his belief that it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
