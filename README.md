<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been pretty crazy in the world lately. In the US, there are allegations of the government ignoring warnings about exploited migrant children; politicians are debating how to manage the nation&#39;s debt; and a Republican House member is facing criminal investigations despite running for re-election. Overseas, Russia is invading Ukraine, sending a shockwave throughout NATO, and there is chaos erupting in Sudan that could potentially disrupt an entire region. In sports, a top Kenyan runner has moved to Boulder, Colorado and is training for her first marathon. In the food world, a cookie chain called Crumbl is taking America by storm -- people can&#39;t decide if they love it or hate it!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
