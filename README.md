<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is seeing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, even with incomplete information coming from the Chinese government. Unfortunately, there is also some bad news in the sports world- soccer legend Pelé died at age 82. This loss has left him remembered as one of the most influential soccer players ever and Brazil&#39;s ambassador to the world. There has also been severe weather in the U.S., with a storm in Buffalo being so deadly. And in Ukraine, Russian missiles are taking out their air defense system. Back on American shores, Southwest Airlines has been experiencing significant flight delays and cancellations due to winter weather, causing travelers to become anxious and police officers threatening those that haven&#39;t left airports with arrest. In the fashion world, Vivienne Westwood, who was responsible for bringing provocative punk style to high fashion, died at age 81; her influence will be felt across decades.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
