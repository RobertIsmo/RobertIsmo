<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there&#39;s a lot happening in the world! In the United States, there&#39;s an investigation into the Supreme Court on abortion inquiry and a seized important documents from President Biden&#39;s home by DOJ. In Ukraine, a missile strike signified the ever-present danger of war. There are also controversial discussions on exceptions of abortion bans and complex college finance aid processes. Another interesting news is about Taiwan representative being involved in a diplomatic struggle with China which can potentially lead to war. Brazil is protecting its indigenous people with the help of 91 year old photographer. NFL issued safety warning while Giants&#39; defense is enjoying sneaker talks and company of assistant coach Wink Martindale. Lastly, The Weekender shared 27 New Yorkers sharing their salaries and some fun activities to do at home.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
