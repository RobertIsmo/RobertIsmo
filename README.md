<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world lately! In the US, Donald Trump is trying to get union support from UAW, and there&#39;s a new Black woman leading the troubled police force in Louisville. Over in the UK, their government recently had some by-elections with mixed results. On the climate front, June was Earth&#39;s hottest month on record so far and August looks to be more of the same. In grim news, some police investigators have been looking into a suspect from a case at Gilgo Beach for years without luck; however they now have a new clue that could help them solve it. Sadly, an unexpected tornado in Rocky Mount damaged a Pfizer site and caused shortages of vital hospital products. Lastly, NFL fined Daniel Snyder $60 million for sexual harassment and withholding revenue while he owned the Washington Commanders.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
