<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of different issues happening around the world. In the US, investigators are looking into why a Delta flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta was kept on the tarmac in extreme heat, and prosecutors are looking into potential obstruction charges against former President Trump. In news from outside the US, Russian and Turkish relations have remained strong despite a grain deal collapse, and Ukrainian children with cancer are facing new challenges due to the war with Russia. Additionally, some people face the daunting task of inheriting a genetic mutation that can lead to dementia. The pandemic has also had an effect on TV writing jobs, where studios are increasingly limiting their roles in productions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
