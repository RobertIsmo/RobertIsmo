<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of activity happening around the world right now. In the US, President Joe Biden is fulfilling his campaign promise to end the 20-year war in Afghanistan. In Russia, an ambitious winter offensive has stalled. Meanwhile, Airbus is making plans to double production in China, despite resistance from the Biden administration. In the US, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is trying to corral a fractious Republican majority around a spending plan amid a looming debt crisis. Also in the US, lawmakers in Tennessee are moving to oust some members due to misconduct allegations. And after a school shooting in Nashville, people are trying to reconcile divisions between urban and rural populations. Additionally, Donald Trump is facing criminal charges stemming from the Capitol attack, and Saudi Arabia&#39;s breakaway golf league has sparked controversy as it comes to one of the sport&#39;s most esteemed stages. India has also been making changes to their school textbooks by removing or shrinking references to Hindu extremism and Muslim history. Finally, Rupert Murdoch&#39;s Fox News empire has come under fire over its promotion of election lies and involvement in inciting insurrection.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
