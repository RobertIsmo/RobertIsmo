<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, a dam collapsed on the Dnipro River, forcing residents to flee from cascading floodwaters. Experts are saying an external blast could have caused it, although Moscow and Kyiv are blaming each other. In the US, the Air Quality Index is important to understand and use to stay safe with regards to pollution levels. There are also interesting connections evolving between Trump, Saudi Arabia, and PGA Tour providers like LIV Golf. Other news includes Chris Christie entering 2021&#39;s presidential race as well as a grand jury investigation into Trump&#39;s documents, with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows testifying in relation to the case. Lastly, there is ongoing discussion around whether Florida officials violated any laws while using taxpayer funds to fly migrants to Sacramento and Martha&#39;s Vineyard.</p>
