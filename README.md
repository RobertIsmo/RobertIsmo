<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of political unrest going on right now. In Pennsylvania, there&#39;s been a chaotic struggle for power between donors and the president and chair of the board. In Massachusetts, there&#39;s been debate about academic freedom at Harvard and whether or not their president deserved to stay in her role. Yale University is also involved after a Palestinian flag was hung on a Menorah during a protest. Donald Trump is also in the news as the Supreme Court may have to decide whether he is immune from prosecution. At the same time, issues with rent and homelessness are plaguing low-income families. Even in small towns people are taking notice of how many lights can be put on residential properties. Unfortunately, pedestrian deaths keep rising despite other wealthy countries addressing this issue better. Furthermore, Portland is working to recriminalize public drug usage while Florida&#39;s Governor DeSantis is at odds with Trump about his cowardly refusal to debate his 2020 rival Joe Biden.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
