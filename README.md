<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the U.S.&#39;s Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned that the country could run out of cash by June 1, and called on Congress to take action. This is in a context of an unsteady banking industry, with one bank, First Republic, having been seized by regulators and sold off to JPMorgan Chase. Prisons in the U.S. are facing staff shortages, so they are enlisting teachers and case managers as guards. 

Meanwhile, AI is becoming better at natural language comprehension and mind reading, prompting warnings from experts about its potential for danger. In Ukraine, wet ground is causing challenges for their military as they prepare for a counteroffensive against Russia. In Arizona, Senator Kyrsten Sinema has broken away from the Democratic Party and Republican primaries are getting increasingly hostile. Finally, Washington state&#39;s Governor Jay Inslee will not seek re-election and in Maryland Senator Ben Cardin is retiring which will start competitive primaries for his seat.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
