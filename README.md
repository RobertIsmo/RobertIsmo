<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on in the world right now. In the US, there&#39;s been a lot of controversy surrounding the police and their use of force. There were two police officers who were suspended in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols, and his parents were invited to attend the State of the Union address. On a global scale, there is a conflict brewing between Israel and Palestine, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken currently visiting the region. The IMF has upgraded its economic outlook as inflation eases, and meanwhile Ukraine is asking for help in arming itself against an expected Russian offensive. Italy is seeing a shrinking population as birthrates decline while Hong Kong is facing a dispute over whether to prioritize golf courses or public housing developments. Finally, US President Biden has implemented an elaborate system for handling classified files but more officially records are more casually managed. As for sports news, Philadelphia fans are eagerly waiting the outcome of their Eagles meeting Kansas City in the Super Bowl. And on the arts side of things, fans are looking to emulate their favorite artists by dressing up like them - known as &quot;becoming their avatars.&quot;</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
