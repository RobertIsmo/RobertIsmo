<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on in the world right now. In America, Donald Trump is leading in key battleground states and voters have said they trust him over President Biden economically and for foreign policy. In Israel, there’s been an alleged airstrike in Gaza resulting in multiple casualties, and the Israeli military is engaged in an invasion of Gaza. Meanwhile, American troops who have engaged in an artillery bombardment against the Islamic State have suffered mysterious mental and physical ailments without explanations from the Pentagon. Over here in Philadelphia, Cherelle Parker is set to become the first woman to lead America&#39;s sixth biggest city.</p>

<h3>Why Biden Is Behind, and How He Could Come Back</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
