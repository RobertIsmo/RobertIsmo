<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to catch up and let you know what&#39;s been happening in the news lately. We have experienced a lot of changes in the past few months. Henry Kissinger, one of the most powerful secretaries of state of the postwar era, recently passed away at 100 years old. His impact on Cold War history is still being felt today in international relations with China, Russia, and the Middle East. Another major news event was the hostage exchange between Israel and Palestinians this past week—including the well-known activist Ahed Tamimi. At the same time, an assassination plot has been uncovered in New York that is linked to a killing in Canada and could potentially strain U.S.-India relations. Finally, Elon Musk has stirring up controversy with his opposition to a boycott of his company X, while also making headlines recently by appearing at an exclusive conference about business and politics. On a lighter note, there have been some great new TV shows this year—so if you&#39;re looking for something to watch we have plenty of choices!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
