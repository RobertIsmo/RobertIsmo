<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. US national security officials are warning about A.I., specifically its potential to upend war and cyber conflict. The World Health Organization has just ended the Covid global health emergency designation, although it doesn&#39;t represent any huge improvements in the pandemic. US job growth is remaining strong and bank stocks are shooting higher as the economy rebounds from Covid-19 worries. Meanwhile, Russia is trying to remain focused on their Victory Day holiday while there is unease over the ongoing war in Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary force, is becoming a powerful figure in Russia due to his leadership and use of social media. In video games, there&#39;s lots of buzz around The Legend of Zelda and how it still continues to push boundaries after nearly 4 decades. College President Leon Botstein is stirring controversy by defending taking money from Jeffrey Epstein while many countries with ties to Britain are looking to break away or at least distance themselves from the British monarchy now that Charles III has taken over. And lastly, there&#39;s this flurry of photos circulating of King Charles throughout his life which makes us all appreciate how deeply he cares for the arts and culture.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
