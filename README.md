<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like countries around the world are struggling with a number of different issues. In the US, hardline Republicans are trying to use military spending to push through social issues, while Iowa Republicans are looking to restrict abortion rights. Meanwhile, Turkey and Ukraine are also trying to repair their relationships with the US. We&#39;re also seeing some pretty nasty weather things happen here in the US - heavy flooding in Vermont and extreme heat in Phoenix. On top of that, Microsoft discovered that Chinese hackers had managed to break into government email accounts and steal data. Finally, there&#39;s some lighter news: Baseball Reference just bought a popular new game called Immaculate Grid, and a jury ruled on the true will of Aretha Franklin!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
