<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In business news, the Federal Reserve released hundreds of pages detailing how bank supervision and regulation failed to stop the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. US wages and prices are slowing unevenly, leaving the current economy in a rocky and bumpy state. First Republic&#39;s shares have slipped as their fate remains uncertain, but overall stock values remain positive. Investors who remain patient during a potential recession can still get handsome returns if they stick it out. 

In world news, the US is evacuating American civilians from Sudan by land, and the EU has extended a tariff waiver for Ukrainian grain, despite some protests. In Ukraine, the US is setting up radiation sensors to detect nuclear blasts, and in North Carolina their Supreme Court has reversed itself on a key voting case due to a new partisan mix.

In US news, an Oregon lawyer who used to be Mayor is now homeless. Meanwhile, top Republicans are balking at WinRed’s plan to charge more for online donations and Florida lawmakers are clearing a possible presidential roadblock for existing Governor Ron DeSantis. 

Finally, in NY region news, Governor Kathy Hochul announced in the state budget deal ban on the use of natural gas in all new buildings.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
