<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot of chaos in many parts of the world. In Turkey and Syria, there has been a devastating earthquake that is making it difficult to rescue survivors. There is also conflict in Ukraine between the government and Russian forces that are sending waves of new conscripts. In addition, the U.S. and China are facing a balloon dispute which raises concerns about how China wields its power and could potentially lead to an accidental conflict. There are many ways people can help aid the rescue and recovery efforts in Turkey and Syria. Lastly, in the U.S., police teams have been disbanded due to violence during protests which shows a lack of training amongst N.Y.P.D officers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
