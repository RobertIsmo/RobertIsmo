<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is being pummeled by a pre-holiday snowstorm that&#39;s affecting almost two-thirds of the population. In Buffalo, families are huddling in dark and cold homes, and in Iowa an unfortunate sports reporter was sent out to report on the storm in the middle of the night! On a brighter note, the House has just approved a $1.7 trillion spending package to avoid a shutdown. 

Meanwhile, the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot panel is crafting a legacy report with detailed evidence in order to call for accountability. However, there are still some unanswered questions about what happened in Trump’s SUV during the riot. 

On the health front, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared up misconceptions around morning-after pills that they are not associated with abortion pills.

In business news, Caroline Ellison of Alameda, a trading firm tied closely to FTX admitted involvement in defrauding customers and misleading investors and apologized for her role. On a related note, there are lots of questions about how Sam Bankman-Fried managed to pay his $250 million bail after he was arrested. 

Turning to international news... Ukraine&#39;s security chief has said that the threat of invasion from Belarus is currently low. He also spoke about Russia-Iranian relations and Moscow’s interest in holding jurisdiction over Bakhmut city. On another note, the USA is sending satellite guided bombs worth $1.85 billion to Ukraine as part of its military aid package. 

Finally here at home, George Santos - who was recently elected into congress - has come under scrutiny due to inconsistencies in his campaign biography and some other undisclosed troubles from his past.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
