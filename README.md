<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there&#39;s a dispute within Dianne Feinstein&#39;s family over control of her late husband&#39;s estate, while prosecutors say a former leader of the Bloods has single-handedly remade the emergency mitigation industry in New York through intimidation and brute force. In Texas, there was a sad discovery of a migrant&#39;s corpse in the Rio Grande, and a judge recently sentenced the Pittsburgh Synagogue Gunman to death in court. On top of all that, recent ocean heat records are causing scientists to worry about what it could mean for climate change, while New York City has made outdoor dining permanent with guidelines. There are also plenty of stories about politics, including Mike Pence speaking at a Republican fundraiser and President Trump being charged under an old Reconstruction-era law. Plus, people are starting to see how the college admissions process isn&#39;t everything it&#39;s cracked up to be and how consumer culture is now embedded into our lives like never before.</p>

<h3>Pastor or Traitor? Ukrainians Shun a Church Seen as a Kremlin Tool.</h3>

<p>The village parishioners’ decision to oust their priest reflects a broader push within Ukraine to reduce the influence of an Orthodox church that answers to Moscow.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/47jF11W"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
