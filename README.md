<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot of political chaos going on in the US right now. Speaker Kevin McCarthy is having trouble controlling an unruly majority, and the Republican holdouts don&#39;t seem to be budging. There may even be a potential for a recession this year if the economy isn&#39;t managed well. Elsewhere, it looks like the Eurozone is facing deflation too. On a brighter note, NFL players are relieved after they got great news about Damar Hamlin&#39;s health.

Unfortunately, we&#39;re also seeing some unfortunate news coming out of China. People are preparing to make their annual trips home for lunar new year despite a surge of covid cases, which could cause further spread in rural areas which have limited medical services. To top it off, Southwest Airlines had some massive malfunctions that have stranded tons of travelers and cost them a lot of money.</p>

<p>As the Republican leader has made concessions to the far right, he has effectively agreed to give them carte blanche to disrupt the workings of the House — and to hold him hostage to their demands.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3imfW1R"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Just What Do McCarthy’s Antagonists Want, and Why Won’t They Budge?</h3>

<p>The Republican holdouts are showing that party leaders’ usual methods of arm-twisting no longer work. “It’s not about policies, it’s about the fight,” said one former operative.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3GKvgii"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
