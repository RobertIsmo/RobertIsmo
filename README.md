<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot going on in the world, ranging from global politics to the everyday lives of Americans. On the global level, tensions between Israel and Hamas have been rising after an explosion at a Palestinian hospital was suspected to be caused by a Palestinian group, according to US officials. Meanwhile, China and Russia are beginning to form close ties in order to challenge American dominance. In the US, there has been a resurgence of partisanship which has caused some Harvard students to be doxxed for writing an anti-Israel letter. Americans are also seeing their net worth soar due to the pandemic’s economic boost. On a smaller scale, Quavo, member of hip hop group Migos, released a solo album while mourning his nephew&#39;s death last November and Texas is trying to change how migrants are treated by considering arresting them instead of busing them. New York City has also implemented new restrictions on housing migrant families as they attempt to deal with an overwhelming surge of immigrants.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
