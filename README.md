<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is experiencing a lot of conflict right now. In Russia, Western technology goods have been winding up in missiles, raising questions about the efficacy of sanctions against them. In Moscow, an American named Evan Gershkovich has made his first court appearance since he was detained last month. Diplomats from the Group of 7 nations held a meeting and came to agreement on how to proceed with Russian aggression in Ukraine and Chinese assertiveness. Here in the U.S., the FBI is building a war crimes case against Syrian officials for their role in a brutal detention and torture system under President Bashar al-Assad. Additionally, there is a case involving an 84-year-old being charged in the shooting of a Black teenager who went to the wrong house and another man charged with murder in the shooting of a woman who went up a wrong driveway in upstate New York. Meanwhile, Mexico has become the biggest user of a notorious spy tool called Pegasus. Finally, there have been satellite launches that could potentially threaten astronomy but some scientists see this as an opportunity for research into things like gamma rays and space weather. Lastly, there is chaos erupting in Sudan between two military factions causing plans for transition to a civilian-led democracy to be put on hold.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
