<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening in the world right now. Many employers outside of the tech industry are struggling to keep workers, while tech companies like Twitter have had to resort to layoffs. There are conflicts scattered around the globe, such as the never-ending war between Russia and Ukraine, and protests erupting in Mexico over changes to their election agency that could make free and fair elections harder. Climate change is also having an effect on snowboarding brands, who must adapt their strategies according to unpredictable snowfall patterns. Closer to home in the US, the Biden administration is assessing a possible lab leak origin for the COVID pandemic, while a survivor from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing gives his perspective on how far we&#39;ve come in the wake of 9&#x2F;11.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
