<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot of conflict happening around the world. In the US, former president Donald Trump was recently indicted for putting national security secrets at risk and scheming to thwart the investigation into the matter. In Ukraine, there is an ongoing battle between the country and Russian forces as Ukraine tries to retake Russian-occupied territory. In Britain, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson resigned from Parliament after getting a confidential report about whether he had lied about lockdown-breaking parties. In Canada, there are massive wildfires ravaging the country due to climate change. Also in Colombia, four missing children were recently found alive after 40 days in a jungle.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
