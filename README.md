<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it seems like there is a lot going on in the world. In Ukraine, the military is determined to hold out in a city that has been devastated by conflict. In South Korea, the Prime Minister is worried about what will happen if the United States doesn&#39;t offer support. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has proposed rules to encourage the sale of more electric cars and trucks in the United States. There have also been discussions about how good for the planet these electric vehicles will be. In addition, Fed officials are debating how to set policy after bank blowups and a judge has imposed sanctions on Fox News for withholding evidence. On top of that, Donald Trump is being asked about his handling of classified information and he is also asking for a delay in trial for a suit accusing him of rape. In Tennessee, another expelled Democrat has been just sent back to the House. Finally, Cornell University administrators have pushed back against a student assembly vote to require faculty members to alert students to upsetting educational materials.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
