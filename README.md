<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hi friend! There&#39;s been a lot of news lately, and here are some of the big stories: 
In the US, a divided House approved GOP plans to investigate how the government is using its powers against conservatives. In California there have been catastrophic storms that caused a lot of damage. 
Worldwide, there has been bloodshed as Russia takes control of an important town in Ukraine, which is now locked in a war zone. Meanwhile, President Biden is facing questions about classified documents in his office. There are also comparisons to what happened with President Trump&#39;s office.

In Peru, the death toll from violence has risen to 47, leaving activists shocked over what they describe as a &quot;massacre&quot;. On a more positive note, the Golden Globes Awards were recently televised and there was good anticipation around who&#39;d win.

Finally - this week President Biden wrapped up a visit to Mexico where he discussed important topics like immigration, climate change and drug trafficking. Despite some rocky moments, it looks like he managed to build up rapport with Mexico&#39;s leader. On the home front, we have an 18 year old Mayor in Earle Arkansas trying to turn things around - and locals hoping that his energy might help bring in some new businesses like maybe even a supermarket!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
