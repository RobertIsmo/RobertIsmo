<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of important news to keep up with in the world right now. For example, in the US, there is a big debate over how politics has shaped how we think about the origin of Covid-19. In Europe, there has been an increase of Americans purchasing houses in order to enjoy a lifestyle they can&#39;t afford in major US cities. In Russia, Vladimir Putin recently took a visit to Mariupol, a city that was razed by Russian forces. This comes shortly after the International Court of Justice issued a warrant for his arrest for war crimes. There is also the 20th anniversary of the Iraq War and many are still left wondering why the US invaded in the first place.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
