<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Syria, many refugees who died in an earthquake have been returned home to their families so they can be buried among them. In the US, President Biden is trying to win back white working-class voters with wallets, while at the same time pursuing a big-government agenda and pushing for police reform. Meanwhile, China is reportedly sending spy balloons all over the world, and investigators believe Putin likely approved a missile system that brought down Flight MH17. In the technology sector, search engine Bing just made some serious improvements with A.I., but there are also concerns about A.I. chatbots spreading disinformation. In Japan, retired mobsters are finding a new purpose in joining a softball team. Across the pond in LA, Gustavo Dudamel&#39;s influence goes beyond the concert hall as he leaves for New York. Finally, New York City is busing migrants hoping to find asylum in Canada up north.</p>

<h3>Biden Aims to Win Back White Working-Class Voters Through Their Wallets</h3>
<sub>By Jonathan Weisman</sub>

<h3>China Sends Spy Balloons Over Military Sites Worldwide, U.S. Officials Say</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
