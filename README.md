<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it seems like there&#39;s a lot of new and different technology being used to help keep people safe and healthy. Companies are using sensors to detect potential hazards in indoor air, especially with the ongoing pandemic. It&#39;s been really hot in Texas lately where some prisons don&#39;t even have air conditioning, so that&#39;s been difficult for inmates. In Russia, a military leader&#39;s departure has highlighted communication and coordination issues in the country. Over in Ukraine, the invasion has been going on for over a year now and is causing a lot of trauma for the people living there. 
Switching gears, the Supreme Court has come to lots of important decisions concerning abortion, guns, religion and climate change recently — I&#39;m sure more will come this year as well. On a less serious note, we just had its first perfect game since 2012 with Yankees pitcher Domingo Germán absolutely crushing against the Oakland Athletics! Oh, and there&#39;s also this huge equal-rights movement being funded by Democrats to help with 2024 N.Y. House campaigns. Finally, Republicans are struggling a bit when it comes to criticizing President Biden since they voted for several of his economic bills anyway. 
Phew! All in all — it&#39;s been an eventful few months!</p>

<h3>Republicans’ Problem in Attacking Biden: They Helped Pass His Economic Bills</h3>

<p>No doubt they will take swings at him anyway.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
