<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some major developments in US politics, with the office of the special counsel accusing Donald Trump and a property manager of deleting security footage at Mar-a-Lago and an indictment into Trump&#39;s handling of sensitive government documents shortly after he left office. Additionally, Republicans in the Senate just passed a bipartisan defense bill, but there&#39;s tension in the House between Democrats and Republicans over money and policy. In other news, famous bass player Randy Meisner from the band The Eagles died at 77, and there is a tribute article about a &quot;punk rock Warhol&quot; artist who also recently died. Lastly, there is an article paying tribute to Irish singer Sinead O&#39;Connor for her courage to confront church abuse both in Ireland and in the US before it was taken seriously by many.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
