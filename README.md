<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Eastern Europe, Bulgaria has been helping Ukraine search for old Soviet-era ammunition to arm their forces. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is raising awareness on Russia and China&#39;s restricted relationships with them due to U.S. sanctions. In Ukraine, one business has managed to survive and even thrive despite a year of war in the region. In America, House Speaker McCarthy has come under fire for re-litigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack with the help of a Fox News host. Additionally, former members of the far-right group the Proud Boys are testifying to their plans of an almost &quot;all-out revolution.&quot; Additionally, in Turkey and Mexico, citizens are questioning their government’s democratic institutions and elections due to issues such as safety standards and benefit changes&#x2F;neglect respectively. On a more personal, day-to-day level, people are struggling with how to talk about the COVID-19 pandemic which is still impacting many individuals. And finally, in India, a wrestling academy for young women has opened up for those looking for freedom and hope in their lives.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
