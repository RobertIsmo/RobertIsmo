<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is going through some difficult times right now. The global economy is facing big problems, including an ongoing crisis of confidence in China. Consumers in the US are showing signs of stress too, which makes sense as the Federal Reserve&#39;s chair recently said that the fight against inflation isn&#39;t over yet. Meanwhile, some Silicon Valley tech billionaires are taking on a huge project to build a city from scratch in the San Francisco area. 

In other news, Russia appears to be pursuing long-term influence operations directed at both the US and Europe, while back home in America, 19 people have been charged in an expansive legal case involving former President Trump&#39;s attempts to hold on to power. In the entertainment world, the director of London&#39;s British Museum stepped down after an employee was fired for theft, and Yale students were angered by a safety flier with a picture of the Grim Reaper that was shared by their campus police (who are renegotiating a contract). Finally, in Hawaii, officials recently released a list of 388 people missing from major wildfires that devastated parts of Maui. It&#39;s certainly not an easy time for anyone!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
