<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there&#39;s a lot of tension between the Ukraine and Russia. Putin recently visited occupied Ukraine to send a defiant message, signaling that the Kremlin is trying to keep up business as usual despite an international court&#39;s arrest warrant for Putin. He may be taking more Ukrainian children which would be a crime in progress. Meanwhile in the US, Sandy Hook families are fighting Alex Jones and the bankruptcy system itself for more than $1.4 billion for Jones&#39; lies, and Trump is claiming his own arrest is imminent and calling for protests, echoing Jan. 6. In Japan kerosene is being used to artificially ripen strawberries. On a lighter note, there&#39;s an intriguing secret involving a Texas politician who sabotaged Carter&#39;s reelection campaign in 1980 and in Oregon there&#39;s talk of secession due to a rural-urban divide. Then - finally - unrelated to all of this, the men&#39;s NCAA basketball tournament is underway! Kansas, the reigning champion, was just knocked out, but the Princeton Tigers made it through to the round of 16 and are celebrating with St. Thomas Aquinas who helped teach them their turnaround style.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
