<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news lately in terms of politics, economics, and health. The US economy looks to be improving with strong data buoying President Biden&#39;s ratings. Biden and Trump are tied in the polls, but voters who don&#39;t like either candidate seem to be giving Biden a slight edge. In Florida, Ron DeSantis’s Super PAC spent $34 million trying to boost his standing but it didn&#39;t have much success. After paying legal bills for former president Donald J. Trump and his associates, his PAC is nearly broke. For the first Republican debate, there will be at least seven candidates so far though Trump may not attend. In Ukraine, Russian threats have hampered small ports on the Danube river while reducing grain exports. In New York, Joe Petrsoric is retiring from Broadway saloon after memorizing the favorite drinks of all the top stars. A new energy efficiency rule that started over a decade ago has kicked in which has made most incandescent lights obsolete. Sheila Oliver has died in New Jersey from being taken to the hospital on Monday while Governor Murphy was out of state. Matthew DePerno from Michigan who unsuccessfully tried to overturn the 2020 election has been charged with election breach and he also finished second to lead the state&#39;s Republican Party. Lastly, Oregon continues its experiment which focuses on curbing opioid overdoses by handing out tickets for using Fentanyl over jail time. Finally, Senator&#39;s Nadine Menendez marriage appear to have caught investigators&#39; attention because they seem to be looking into the possibility that she or her husband might have received undisclosed gifts.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
