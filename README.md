<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a number of interesting things happening in the world right now. The FDA has just approved the first ever over-the-counter birth control pill, potentially expanding access to contraception for many. In Hollywood, actors are preparing to strike because contract negotiations have collapsed, joining screenwriters who have been picketing for over 70 days. Meanwhile, President Biden has recently pledged long-term backing for Ukraine as the U.S. election rolls around. Democrats are trying to resurrect the Equal Rights Amendment to enshrine a guarantee of sex equality into the Constitution using a creative legal theory. The FTC has opened an investigation into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which makes the artificial intelligence chatbot technology, over potential harms and security practices. A biography on physicist Robert Oppenheimer that was 25 years in the making is set to be released soon too, written by Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird. Finally, while politicians cry crisis due to migrants arriving in New York City, economists claim that their arrival will eventually be a boon. Looming U.S. investment restrictions on China threaten diplomatic outreach as Germany releases a strategy statement on dealing with their largest trading partner. And in Pittsburgh, jurors are deciding whether Robert Bowers—accused of massacring 11 Jews at a synagogue—is eligible for death penalty sentencing or life in prison, looking particularly at Tropical Storm Irene flood defenses in Vermont that have proven both successful and insufficient over time due to increasingly extreme storms across the nation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
