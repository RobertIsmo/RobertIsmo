<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of developments happening in the world right now. In the US, the Supreme Court is dealing with legal issues related to President Trump&#39;s possible presidential run. Maine&#39;s secretary of state had to make a difficult decision to disqualify him from the ballot. Meanwhile, in Russia, there&#39;s a law banning anyone from discrediting their army, leading to thousands of people being punished for even minor acts or statements. And in Ukraine, there have been large-scale air attacks that killed 30 people and damaged important infrastructure. Closer to home, NYC officials are assuring revelers ahead of New Year&#39;s festivities and there has been a decline in homicides despite the pandemic. Other places are facing challenges too: Palestinians in Gaza feel unsafe following an airstrike and we&#39;ve recently heard of Israeli military forces killing three hostages. Lastly, here in NYC itself, a large grand hotel was destroyed due to economic reasons and we can still see a piece of its history through a shop window. Lastly, Ohio&#39;s governor vetoed a bill that would have banned transition care for minors and prohibited transgender girls&#x2F;women from certain sports teams. There are also questions about how the new Pentagon plans on reducing civilian deaths will affect US aid to Israel.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
