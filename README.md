<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, a lot is going on in the world, and especially among the US and China. President Biden and Chinese President Xi are meeting in California to try and stabilize their relations. The agenda includes topics such as Taiwan, election interference, and the war in the Middle East. In San Francisco, they&#39;re trying to clean up before major world leaders arrive for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. On top of that, the US is trying to resume military dialogue with Beijing. Elsewhere, there are still ongoing issues in Gaza, with an extensive maze of tunnels beneath it allowing Hamas fighters to smuggle weapons and goods. In Germany&#39;s debate over pro-Palestinian voices versus free speech, the country has been banning some protests what many people believe to be discriminatory. In politics, there&#39;s worry about abortion curbs alienating voters and talk about Joe Manchin potentially running as third-party in 2024. In Johannesburg a deadly fire exposes an existing problem with lax housing laws, while in New York City Trump gets attacked by republican allies after testifying in civil fraud trial. Lastly, there will be more decisive updates soon since a judge is pushing back decision on whether to delay former president Trump&#39;s documents trial.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
