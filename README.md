<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It’s been a busy news week. On the health front, a court ruling invalidated the FDA&#39;s approval for an abortion pill and could put a strain on the drug industry&#39;s reliance on the agency. In Louisville, Ky., a shooting left four dead and nine injured, with the motive currently unknown. Nationwide, the U.S. has faced scores of mass shootings already in 2023 alone. The latest documents leaked from the Trump administration have raised fresh concerns over how this could all be dealt with in future operations. In Ukraine, soldiers are learning how to cope with combat stress while closer to home, Americans have been faced by bank collapses which may lead to an economic slowdown. Elon Musk&#39;s Bitcoin mines obsession is taking its toll too, as it uses up masses of energy and public funds in order to cash in on it. Lastly, charges were filed against the mother of a six-year-old who shot his teacher within an elementary school in January.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
