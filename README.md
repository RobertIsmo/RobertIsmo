<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world related to political and legal issues. In the United States, former President Donald Trump is facing an indictment for his role in the election, and his lawyers are enmeshed in a conflict of interests surrounding witnesses. Prosecutors of the Capitol Riot are asking for protection due to threatening posts from Trump. On the campaign trail, it&#39;s hard to avoid the fallout from Trump&#39;s legal issues. Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has received funding for an expensive RV from a friend. Overseas, Ukraine is trying to use diplomatic measures to weaken Russia and hold them accountable for war crimes. Russian leadership has been criticized for its authoritarian response to protests, while Pope Francis declined to criticize Russia at a World Youth Day event. Finally, investigations have been ongoing into how Chinese propaganda has infiltrated U.S. tech companies. Lastly, Taylor Swift&#39;s popular &quot;Eras&quot; tour has been dominating the summer and delighting fans around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
