<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening around the globe that&#39;s concerning. In Ukraine, US officials are warning of potential danger if air defense and munitions assistance aren&#39;t implemented soon. Meanwhile in Europe, experts are skeptical about whether or not the pledged assistance will be enough for Ukraine&#39;s needs. On an international level, we&#39;re seeing leaked intelligence reports start to dribble onto the web. 

Closer to home, the fight over Medicaid expansion in North Carolina has reached a tipping point after intense patient advocacy and shifting politics have led the state to join 39 others in expanding access. Closer still, Stanford Law School is trying to take a stand for free speech after student protests in an interesting way. And gig workers delivering food face brutal mathematics when it comes to low tips. 

In El Salvador, the country has delivered a stunning blow to gangs over the last year with a state of emergency--but at what cost? And back here in the States, New Mexico is facing a unique potential loss: a dialect spoken nowhere else on Earth for over 400 years. 

On a lighter note, Jon Rahm won his first Masters tournament this weekend and veteran Phil Mickelson earned redemption from fans with his best final round in thirty years at the tournament.</p>

<h3>Leaked Documents Suggest Ukrainian Air Defense Is in Peril if Not Reinforced</h3>
<sub>By Helene Cooper, Michael Schwirtz and Thomas Gibbons-Neff</sub>
<p>A huge influx of munitions is needed to keep Russia’s air force from changing the course of the war, according to U.S. officials and newly leaked Pentagon documents.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3o2Lz36"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Europe Has Pledged a Million Shells for Ukraine in a Year. Can It Deliver?</h3>

<p>Probably not, experts say, given the shrunken state of its military industrial sector. A look at a major munitions maker helps explain why.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3GtzaLG"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>At Stanford Law School, the Dean Takes a Stand for Free Speech. Will It Work?</h3>

<p>After a student protest, Jenny S. Martinez wrote a much-praised memo defending academic freedom.

<h3>$388 in Sushi. Just a $20 Tip: The Brutal Math of Uber Eats and DoorDash</h3>

<p>Delivery drivers were hailed as pandemic heroes.

<h3>New Mexico Is Losing a Form of Spanish Spoken Nowhere Else on Earth</h3>

<p>A dialect from the state’s earliest Spanish-speaking settlers has endured for over 400 years in the state’s remote mountain villages.

<h3>Will North Carolina Be the ‘Beginning of the End’ of the Medicaid Expansion Fight?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
