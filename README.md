<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
At the moment, global temperatures are rising quickly due to the effects of greenhouse gases and El Niño. This has been causing record-high temperatures around the globe. For example, in Mexico&#39;s northern city of Hermosillo, temperatures have been reaching an unbelievable 120 degrees.

In terms of health news, a new Alzheimer&#39;s drug called Leqembi has just been made widely accessible after receiving full approval from the F.D.A., although with a warning about potential safety risks. Medicare will cover most of the cost for those who need it.

The workforce is also undergoing some significant changes, with many job-switching opportunities popping up leading to higher wages for low-income workers. Despite this, ex-prisoners face tremendous hurdles when seeking employment as only 60 percent are employed a year later.

Elsewhere, Belarus&#39; autocratic leader Aleksandr G. Lukashenko has made claims about a photo of a fallen police officer in his wallet - although some have called his story&#39;s validity into question - and U.S. is on track to finish its arsenal of chemical weapons by Friday.

Meanwhile there is drama in the tech world as well. Tom Brady&#39;s ambitions in crypto crashed hard, while Instagram released an app Threads which quickly racked up 30 million downloads in 16 hours - angering rival Twitter - and Taylor Swift escaped unscathed. Lastly, Delia Owens and her husband are trying to fight poachers in order to save Zambian elephants, although their efforts have divided opinions among locals in the area.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
