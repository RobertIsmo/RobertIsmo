<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of tension between Israel and Palestine that is escalating, and two activists from the region have asked Americans to pick a side of peace. There is controversy over some content shared on TikTok being anti-Israel, and people like Sacha Baron Cohen are speaking out against it. On top of this, Elon Musk recently posted an antisemitic post, leading IBM and other companies to pull advertising from the platform. 

President Biden had a meeting with Xi Jinping, the top leader in China, where both countries discussed their differences and how to move forward in a positive way. China is also trying to revive its economy by bulldozing old neighborhoods, which could be financially beneficial but would displace many people.

Football has been linked to brain diseases like CTE because of hits to the head, so there&#39;s now research going into how to make the sport safer for players. In NYC, some empty office buildings are being converted into housing in a financial district to house many families. Universities like Johns Hopkins University are also taking notes from this idea and transforming museums into modern centers for students. Finally, Congressman George Santos has been accused of using campaign money on personal indulgences like Ferragamo clothing and Botox treatments in Hamptons and Atlantic City.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
