<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been quite a few events happening in the world lately! In Ukraine, there was an epic battle of tanks which resulted in a stinging setback for Russia. Here in the US, lawmakers are questioning the Pentagon&#39;s use of funds for Ukraine, and in Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot lost her bid for re-election. Meanwhile, in Nigeria Bola Tinubu ran for president and promised to tackle economic woes. On the immigration front, many undocumented immigrants have been returning home, and unfortunately there was a train crash in Greece that killed at least 36 people. An Israeli raid on a safehouse also ended with civilian casualties due to the ripple effect. Here in the US, Biden is betting on government aid to change corporate behavior while trying to highlight Republican proposals when it comes to budget cuts. There&#39;s a revolutionary stroke treatment that will save millions of lives, but it needs to be done quickly. Lastly, at this year&#39;s CPAC conference many of the potential 2024 rivals decided to skip it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
