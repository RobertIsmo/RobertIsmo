<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot is going on in the world right now. In Gaza, families are living in fear and guilt knowing their loved ones are suffering as a result of the siege there. Retailers are getting nervous ahead of Black Friday because people could be in a sour mood due to the higher prices and waning savings. On the topic of holidays, we have instructions for how to clean up after Thanksgiving dinner like a pro. Financially speaking, the US and Canada have responded with alarm after two people died in an intense car crash at the Canadian border. In a dispute with Russia, Finland has dramatically closed its borders. As for politics, Putin is due for reelection next year as he continues to lead task forces towards Ukraine; while his march towards power appears certain, other parts of the world are in turmoil with no end in sight.  That&#39;s not all though: India is reportedly attempting assassinations abroad, while the Netherlands has seen an extreme political shift towards far-right parties like Geert Wilders&#39;. There&#39;s also this new movie about Napoleon coming out which Joaquin Phoenix stars in—at least there&#39;s something entertaining to come out of this news dump!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
