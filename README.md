<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a tense truce between Israel and Hamas following seven weeks of war. As part of the truce, Hamas has released two dozen hostages and Israel has released 39 imprisoned Palestinians. Over 130 aid trucks have reached Gaza on the first day of the truce. In West Bank, families waited outside a prison for the release of people detained by Israel while in Israel 13 Israeli hostages were released back home. Meanwhile in the business world, several companies are facing huge financial losses due to one CEO&#39;s endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory. In the US, more and more Chinese citizens are crossing into the US from Mexico and in Georgia liberal organizers are struggling to keep organized efforts going amid a changed political landscape. Additionally, a North Korean soccer prodigy recently made an international appearance for the first time since 2020 when UN sanctions led to his career break. Finally, a new biopic about Napoleon has recently been released to mixed reviews from French critics.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
