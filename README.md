<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, they are preparing for war in Gaza with a debate over how and how long they should fight. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are struggling to find room for the dead as warnings of a crisis in Gaza mount. In Iran, they have been denied access to $6 billion from a prisoner deal by the US and Qatar. Here in the US, House Republicans are in chaos after Scalise withdrew his candidacy as speaker, and they are unable to unite due to internal divisions. This has left Congress hobbled at a time when there are international and domestic crises. A trial over the death of Elijah McClain resulted in a surprising split decision; one officer was convicted while another was acquitted. There are also billboards in Israel thanking President Biden for his warm embrace after Trump was so closely tied with the Israeli right. But Biden is keeping one eye on the home front too; he&#39;s done events related to economic issues while managing this conflict between Israel and Hamas. In October, we will get to see a ring of fire solar eclipse sweeping across much of the Western Hemisphere! On top of that, Senator Bob Menendez and his wife have been charged with plotting to make him a foreign agent. Lastly, prosecutors issued an error-riddled report regarding Menendez&#39;s car crash where his wife killed a pedestrian with her Mercedes-Benz but she was not charged.</p>

<h3>As Israel Prepares for War in Gaza, Debate Is Over How and How Long</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
