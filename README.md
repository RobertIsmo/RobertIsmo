<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hello! I&#39;m catching you up on some of the big news stories happening around the world. President Biden is facing divisions inside the White House and beyond over his solidarity with Israel, but Hamas has released another group of 12 hostages and a fragile cease-fire continues. Malawi is sending thousands of farmworkers to Israel and Chinese families are sending money overseas as a sign of worry about their economic and political future. In addition, US-China student exchanges are under threat due to geopolitics, former California Governor Gavin Newsom is debating current Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is vying for the No. 2 position in the Republican presidential race, Koch Network has endorsed Nikki Haley as they try to push the GOP past Trump, The New York Times Book Review has chosen its 10 best books of 2023, and Rosalynn Carter was honored at her memorial service by presidents and first ladies. Finally, NATO leaders are concerned about US aid for Ukraine as American funding is running down and a counteroffensive appears stalled. Wow, that&#39;s a lot of news!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
