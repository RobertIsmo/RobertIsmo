<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, world events are quite unpredictable. In Ukraine, the country and its Western backers are facing a ticking clock as they prepare for a counteroffensive against Russia. Recently, Ukraine shot down one of Russia&#39;s most advanced missiles using a newly delivered U.S.-made Patriot air-defense battery. Meanwhile, in the UK, Charles was crowned King in an ancient ceremony that had modern twists. It was the first coronation since Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s in 1953 and a royal spectacle only Britain still stages. 

In the US, there was a tragic shooting at a Texas mall that left nine dead including the gunman and the motive is still unclear. On the lighter side, some major events also took place over the weekend such as the Kentucky Derby and King Charles&#39; coronation which ignited many discussions over fashion and hats. Lastly, the issue of backup power has become more prominent with extreme weather linked to climate change causing more blackouts--but unfortunately, generators and batteries are still out of reach for many people.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
