<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now! In the US, North Carolina just had its Supreme Court reverse a decision on Gerrymandering that reflects the politicization of courts nationally. Montana has also signed a bill banning transgender care for minors, and New York just toughened up its bail law for more judicial discretion. On the business side, there&#39;s been some regulatory reviews on failed banks from the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 

Internationally, the US is evacuating American civilians from Sudan, and there was a large fuel tank fire burning in Crimea with speculation of a drone attack. The EU has extended a tariff waiver for Ukrainian grain, despite some protests, and Spain is baking in summer-like heat, worrying about what comes next. 

All in all, not an easy time right now!</p>

<h3>North Carolina Gerrymander Ruling Reflects Politicization of Judiciary Nationally</h3>
<sub>By Michael Wines</sub>
<p>When it had a Democratic majority last year, the North Carolina Supreme Court voided the state’s legislative and congressional maps as illegal gerrymanders. Now the court has a Republican majority, and says the opposite.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/44bcCcU"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Montana Governor Signs Law Banning Transgender Care for Minors</h3>

<h3>New York Will Toughen Contentious Bail Law to Give Judges More Discretion</h3>
<sub>By Jesse McKinley, Grace Ashford and Hurubie Meko</sub>
<p>State leaders agree to eliminate a provision that requires judges to prescribe the “least restrictive” means to ensure defendants return to court.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3HnmVAJ"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Gov. Hochul Gets a Budget Deal, but No Signature Win</h3>

<p>The budget deal contained a series of hard-fought wins for the governor, but left her without a grand policy achievement to trumpet.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Lk7evD"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Fed Slams Its Own Oversight of Silicon Valley Bank in Post-Mortem</h3>
<sub>By Jeanna Smialek</sub>
<p>The Federal Reserve released hundreds of pages documenting how bank supervision and regulation failed to prevent the lender’s collapse. The F.D.I.C. released a separate report on Signature Bank.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3AC41mc"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Key Takeaways From Regulatory Review of Bank Failures</h3>
<sub>By Emily Flitter, Jeanna Smialek and Alan Rappeport</sub>

<h3>Large Fuel Tank Fire Burns in Crimea After Suspected Drone Attack</h3>
<sub>By Victoria Kim</sub>
<p>A Russian-installed local official did not specify who might be behind such an attack. Ukraine typically maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity about strikes in Crimea.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3AINrAM"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>E.U. Extends Tariff Waiver for Ukrainian Grain, Despite Some Protests</h3>
<sub>By Matina Stevis-Gridneff</sub>
<p>The bloc will provide more than $100 million to farmers in eastern countries where tariff-free Ukrainian grain produced a supply glut and plunging prices.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3n7GHtp"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>McCarthy Brought His Detractors in From the Cold. Will They Stay?</h3>

<p>The speaker’s all-carrots, no-sticks approach of empowering hard-right Republicans carries risks, and any negotiation with President Biden on the debt ceiling is likely to test them.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3oQb5J6"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Campaign, Interrupted: Pence May Run, but He Can’t Hide From Trump’s Legal Woes</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
