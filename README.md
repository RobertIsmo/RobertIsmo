<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like there is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, four members of the Proud Boys have been convicted of sedition in a case related to the January 6th storming of the US Capitol. There&#39;s tension between Ukraine and Russia over possible drone attacks near Moscow. South African leaders allowed a Russian plane under US sanctions to land at a military base, which could lead to more tensions between those countries. In New York, there have been no arrests yet for the death of someone who was put in a police chokehold.

In addition, there are some financial worries with small banks and the herder market. Though Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell believes this time is different from past recessions, fears still abound. In other news, an autopsy report came out that someone died of head injuries due to a police beating. Also, &#39;superfake&#39; handbags are becoming popular as almost nobody can tell them apart from expensive designer ones - though there&#39;s controversy over one man who&#39;s being sued by his former wife&#39;s friends over text messages involving her abortion. Finally, people should enjoy top racehorses while they can as they won&#39;t be around for long as they&#39;ll be headed to breeding sheds where the real money is soon enough.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
