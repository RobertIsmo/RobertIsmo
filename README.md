<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot happening in the world recently. In an unprecedented move, officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia have been visiting each other&#39;s countries, symbolizing a normalizing of their relationship. Meanwhile, the U.S. Congress is edging closer to a possible government shutdown because of hard-right House Republicans blocking measures to fund it. Oil prices have also seen an incredible spike recently - analysts are trying to understand why. Air travel might be disrupted if the U.S government shuts down, and former President Donald Trump had fraud charges against him unanimously upheld by a judge in New York. On top of that, Senator Robert Menendez and his wife Nadine pleaded not guilty to bribery charges. There&#39;s set to be a second Republican presidential debate soon which may reveal changes in the dynamics of the race, and Donald Trump recently tried to court blue collar workers at a non-union factory in response to President Biden appearing on a union picket line. Lastly, three Black women are traveling around the country trying to preserve desecrated African American burial grounds and their histories. All in all its been pretty intense!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
