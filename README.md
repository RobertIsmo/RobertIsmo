<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the US is facing quite a few legal issues. There&#39;s a new asylum policy that has been blocked by a federal judge, and then there&#39;s an inquiry into Harvard&#39;s legacy admissions policies after the Supreme Court limited affirmative action. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a study suggesting that very rich students get into elite colleges just based on their wealth. 

Internationally, a foreign minister in China was unexpectedly removed after a month without any news from him, while Israel is bracing for what comes next after passing a judicial law. As for the protesters of this law, they seem to have fallen into a somber mood and are still trying to come to terms with this defeat. 

On the business side of things, United Parcel Service (UPS) has reached a tentative deal with Teamsters to avoid a potential strike. The global economy is also showing signs of recovery with an upgrade from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 

Back home in the US, Governor DeSantis has cut his presidential campaign staff by a third as part of an effort to rein in costs. Lastly, it looks like climate change could push the Atlantic past a tipping point later this century, and there are maps tracking air quality and smoke from wildfires we can check out for updates.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
