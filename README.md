<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the US and around the world. In the US, the House has narrowly approved changes to their rules amid concerns from certain members, and Republicans are trying to cut funding for the IRS. On an international level, Ukraine is going toe-to-toe with Russia in a war, and Brazil’s democracy is being threatened by conspiracy theories. Other news in the US include Biden’s lawyers finding classified material at his former office, an injured football player being transferred from Cincinnati to Buffalo, and a 6-year-old bringing a gun from home to a school shooting in Newport News. In California, there are storms and mudslides causing evacuations in Montecito. Lastly, there is also news about Prince Harry&#39;s confessional tour coming to an end.</p>

<h3>Without Hesitation, Ukraine Goes Toe to Toe With Russia in Bakhmut</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
