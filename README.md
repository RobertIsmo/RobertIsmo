<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some major changes happening in the world right now. In Mexico, the government has made changes to its election agency ahead of next year&#39;s presidential election. This has been part of an ongoing pattern of challenges to democratic institutions in many parts of the Western Hemisphere. Meanwhile, Russia and the US have both shored up alliances through dueling appearances recently. Russia has even had a celebration of war in Moscow while Ukraine hit Russian positions deep behind enemy lines recently too.

Back home in the US, Donald Trump is under investigation for his role in the Capitol Riot on January 6th. His daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been subpoenaed as part of the investigation. Former Proud Boy members have testified that the group was preparing for &quot;all-out revolution&quot; on that day, and we&#39;re now seeing how four different criminal investigations into Trump could reach key decisions soon. 

On a business note, tech mogul Bao Fan has suddenly gone missing in China, which has created a lot of uncertainty in Chinese tech circles. Lastly, we&#39;ve got new insights into your gut microbiome thanks to some expert research that sheds light on digestive health questions! 

Finally, folks in Plains, Georgia - Jimmy Carter&#39;s hometown - are keeping vigil as he enters hospice care due to his advanced age. It&#39;s a somber but strangely special moment for those who are close to him there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
