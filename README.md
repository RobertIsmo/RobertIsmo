<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of international events taking place right now. In the US, Congress is discussing aid to Israel, while Democrats argue for things like civilian security measures. Meanwhile in Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu&#39;s government is pushing him to continue the ceasefire following fighting with Hamas militants. Elsewhere, India is facing accusations for not taking warnings seriously after a tunnel collapse trapped 41 men. Outside of politics, there have been developments on the health front with life expectancy increasing and some incredible TV shows this year. Lastly, in the US we&#39;re seeing a trial beginning for the death of Elijah McClain and celebrating the life of Rosalynn Carter.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
