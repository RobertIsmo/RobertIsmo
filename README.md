<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on right now in the world. In Ukraine, soldiers from towns held by the Russian military are fighting to reclaim them. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin won&#39;t attend a summit in South Africa after that country issued a warrant for him at the International Criminal Court. In the US, charges of obstruction and fraud are being considered against former president Donald Trump for his role in the storming of Capitol Hill - though Republicans seem to be shrugging off the news. In Michigan, 16 people have been charged with taking part in a scheme to try and overturn Trump&#39;s 2020 election loss. There are also protests simmering in Israel as their President addresses Congress, and ocean temperatures reaching record high levels in Florida. In China, official data shows that Covid deaths may have been vastly undercounted, and Henry Kissinger visited and was greeted warmly by officials there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
