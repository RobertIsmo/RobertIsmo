<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot happening in the world over the past week. The Federal Reserve made their 10th rate increase and opened the door to a potential pause, meaning borrowers can expect to pay more on forms of debt and savers can get more bang for their buck. In Moscow, there were explosions above the Kremlin which they are claiming were an assassination attempt on Putin and Ukraine is denying any involvement. Closer to home, there was a shooting in Atlanta which left one dead and four injured and now the suspect has been caught. We’re also hearing a lot about sexual harassment in politics as Kathy Hochul’s former adviser was recently revealed to have multiple complaints of sexual harassment against him. Politically speaking, Democrats are trying to get at least five GOP defections in order to pass a debt-limit increase and we’ve heard Trump will not be calling any witnesses in the case of E. Jean Carroll’s rape accusation against him. Additionally, tensions between Sudan and America have grown due to lack of proper communication and understanding between both parties. As far as New York City goes, there was a homeless man killed while riding the subway after being choked by another rider; this case has been ruled a homicide. Finally, technology is at it again with a new emotional support A.I. companion hitting the market and an article out exploring why Americans feel more pain than before.</p>

<h3>Why Americans Feel More Pain</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
