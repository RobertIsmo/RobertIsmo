<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the UAW (United Automobile Workers) is on strike at factories and distribution centers owned by Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. They have recently expanded the strikes to 38 spare parts distribution centers. At the same time, they remain in talks with Ford and say they have seen progress. Meanwhile, President Biden has weighed in on the strike, saying he defends the workers, but has made no immediate plans to visit them. 

Also, in politics, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey has been charged with bribery six years after his trial for corruption ended with a hung jury. On the international side, Ukraine has been using a fleet of drones to evade and target Russian air defense systems, while also making some progress in their counteroffensive against Russia. However, there has also been an unexpected development: elderly citizens of South Korea are now able to ride the rail system for free and many have taken advantage of it by taking long rides for enjoyment. 

Meanwhile in China there is an increasing alarm over their real estate crisis after a financially troubled firm stopped paying investors and may spark panic. And finally, former hockey enforcer Chris Nilan is trying to answer questions about the CTE before it&#39;s too late and former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey is preparing for a potential political comeback despite having resigned after admitting an extramarital affair with a male employee.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
