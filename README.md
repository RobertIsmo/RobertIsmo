<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are heating up all over the world. In the US, there are legal battles over whether or not Trump can run for President again in 2024 and there are efforts to keep him off the ballot in some states. In Maine, voters disagree on the state&#39;s decision to disqualify former President Donald J. Trump from the ballot. In addition, crime is decreasing and the Governor of Ohio vetoed a bill that would have banned transition care for minors and prevented transgender women from joining corresponding sports teams.

The situation is even more dynamic internationally. Russia has been pounding Ukrainian cities with missiles and drones and silencing wartime dissent by making it illegal to discredit Russia&#39;s military operations overseas. In another act of aggression, they recently sent an associate of Aleksei Navalny, an activist opposing Putin&#39;s government, to prison for 9 years. In Israel, there was a deadly airstrike targeting a senior Hamas leader that killed dozens of civilians in a residential neighborhood.

Finally, California is using innovative solutions to combat water shortages by taxing farmers for their groundwater use - a policy that seems to be improving things. On top of that, there&#39;s an interesting story about some people who sold everything they had to go on a 3-year cruise but were unable to get a suitable ship due to logistical issues. 


Overall, it looks like things are in flux all around the globe!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
