<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, former president Donald Trump faces charges and his potential jury pool is Floridians who have complicated feelings about him. Meanwhile, NATO countries are sending a message to Russia with a major air exercise over Germany, and US lawmakers are asking the White House to punish South Africa for apparently supporting the weapons used in the Ukraine war. In terms of health, we&#39;re learning noise could be taking years off our lives, and in terms of politics, we&#39;re remembering the life and legacies of Silvio Berlusconi, an Italian politician and media mogul who recently passed away. In terms of trends and business news, YouTube star MrBeast has become the Willy Wonka of YouTube, and there&#39;s news out of New York where N.Y.P.D Commissioner Keechant Sewell is resigning. There&#39;s also a groundbreaking climate trial in Montana where 16 young people argue that their state is robbing their future by embracing policies that contribute to climate change.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
