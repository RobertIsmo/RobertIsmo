<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the Middle East, there is an ongoing cycle of extremist violence that is pushing the West Bank to the brink. In America, powerful imagery from the Israel-Gaza war is being misappropriated, while progressive House freshmen struggle to find their footing in a hard-right House. Meanwhile in China, male leaders are pushing women back into traditional roles to respond to its demographic crisis and economic slowdown. 
Environmental issues are also hitting close to home; States have been failing to protect valuable groundwater leading to damaging depletion levels, while wind energy is facing its own set of obstacles that could prevent it from reaching its full potential. Finally, we&#39;ve been hearing more about mass shootings lately, and we know that problems with mental health treatment and weak laws are contributing to this pandemic. The latest example is from Maine, where officials were warned months ago about the shooter&#39;s deteriorating mental state. Kenya’s running prowess has also been tarnished by doping scandals involving nearly 300 athletes since 2015.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
