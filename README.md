<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of news and events happening in the US recently that are important to know about. For instance, Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump&#39;s ex-lawyer who promoted false claims of election fraud, is planning to surrender to authorities in Georgia today. There are also reports on the Trump family&#39;s overseas business dealings and a court case involving documents relating to Trump. 

In the business world, minimum wage jobs aren&#39;t as noteworthy now as they were before because teenagers are earning double the federal wage floor of $7.25. In Japan, there’s a Marxist best-selling book making the case for &quot;degrowth communism&quot; which suggests shrinking could be good for Japan. 

Plus, the Republican presidential debate will take place without Donald Trump. Doug Burgum, one of the longshot GOP candidates, suffered an unfortunate basketball injury ahead of his debate appearance and has been taken to an emergency room. With regards to merchandising for political campaigns, we can expect some surprises and India seems to be transforming the planet&#39;s connection to space exploration with at least 140 registered start-ups in this area. 

Back home, Washington University&#39;s youth gender clinic in St Louis is inundated with people seeking care and mental health support, while in Russia military service is being advertised through media messaging in an effort to recruit more soldiers. That&#39;s a lot of current news!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
