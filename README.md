<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of troubling stories going on in the world right now. In Hawaii, a historic coastal town was devastated by a wildfire, which was possibly caused by the failure of their main utility to preemptively shutoff power. In Ukraine, there&#39;s a growing mental health crisis among soldiers, and their therapists and doctors are struggling to provide enough care for everyone affected. Meanwhile, Brazil is reevaluating their idolization of &quot;Brazil&#39;s Barbie&quot; following critiques that the thin, white woman isn&#39;t representative of the country&#39;s diversity. 

China is having some economic struggles too. This includes dealing with the financial crisis of one of their biggest real estate developers as well as withholding youth unemployment statistics to try and play down negative trends as their growth stalls. 

Closer to home in the U.S., families of 17 sailors killed in the bombing of the U.S.S Cole are waiting for justice, still attending pretrial hearings at Guantánamo Bay since 2011. And finally, a newspaper site in Wisconsin is threatened with being put out-of-business for their reporting about a businessman who uttered an anti-gay slur. A similar situation developed at The Marion County Record after police conducted an unexpected raid on the premises. Thankfully First Amendment advocates are condemning both situations and standing up for free speech rights.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
