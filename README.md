<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, Israel has invaded Gaza after an air campaign killed thousands of Palestinians. This ground assault was done under the shroud of secrecy but outside observers were eventually able to understand what was happening. In other news, U.S. autoworkers just scored big wins in new contracts with carmakers; President Biden even supported them and labor organizers are now looking to help other industries transition to electric vehicles. Meanwhile, police in Maine were informed about a gunman who threatened to carry out a shooting spree months before it happened and Donald Trump has been attempting to use his age against President Biden despite his own verbal slips and gaffes. On the tech front, a crypto empire founder is being held accountable for his words while an social media company&#39;s worth dropped significantly in just one year. Finally, Matthew Perry recently passed away at 54 and the &#39;Friends&#39; cast is mourning this beloved actor’s unexpected death, as its cause remains unknown.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
