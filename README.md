<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot of tension between China and the United States due to their differences on a range of economic and security issues. In addition to this, Russia&#39;s Embassy in Washington has become almost like a battlefield. Ukrainians are also facing problems with a nuclear power plant that Russia occupies. On top of this, there is debate happening in the US about admissions at Harvard possibly favoring wealthy white applicants.

In terms of good news, India is making headway in the world&#39;s space industry and Canada is providing a lesson in the economic toll of climate change. Unfortunately, there have been shootings and gun violence recently in Baltimore and Philadelphia and Israel has launched its biggest air attack on the West Bank in nearly two decades. Lastly, researchers are looking into dementia villages as a way to provide more home care for those suffering from dementia-related illnesses.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
