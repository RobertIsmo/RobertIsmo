<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of interesting things happening in the world lately. For example, Israeli authorities recently discovered that Hamas had been using a secret money machine to fund their weapons and launch attacks on Israel. In the business world, economists are pointing out that the system of financial safeguards created by the US is no longer making sense due to climate change and change in pre-eminent superpower status. 

In the US, many Harvard Jews are wondering what their future holds following a trying week at the university. In addition, the conservative group Moms for Liberty is losing influence and power because of recent scandals and losses. On immigration politics, under the Biden administration things seem to be shifting to the right. 

On other news, electric vehicle buyers may no longer qualify for federal tax credits in 2024 due to certain sourcing regulations. Also, an Emirati company wants to test a form of trading emission reductions even without regulations being agreed upon yet. 

In Ukraine, Marines describe crossing the Dnipro River as a “suicide mission” to try and advance their position against Russian occupation. And following Matthew Perry’s death last October, autopsy reports say he died of “acute effects of ketamine” which is an anesthetic drug increasingly used for treating depression. In addition, an elderly Iranian man has sparked a new “happiness campaign” after his viral dance was seen by many in violation of law.

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
