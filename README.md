<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world are pretty crazy right now. In the US, there have been a few tragic deaths on a submersible, and there&#39;s been some protesting of an Indian leader&#39;s human rights record. In New York, a Republican congressman is dealing with some major financial scandals, while California is worrying about the potential failure of its dams. North Korea has been in the news too; one of its defectors has become a star in right-wing media. Over in the occupied West Bank, there&#39;s been an upswing in violence and tension between Palestinian Authority and Israeli forces. Meanwhile, Florida might be sending 4 candidates for the presidential race, and the Supreme Court recently ruled that Congress can&#39;t make states carry out federal orders. It&#39;s really hectic out there!</p>

<h3>Mark the day: Modi fielded live questions from the press.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
