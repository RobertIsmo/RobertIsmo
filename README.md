<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting developments happening in the world. In Europe, the Dutch government collapsed because members of their coalition couldn&#39;t agree on how to handle refugees and migration. Meanwhile, there are fears that far-right parties will take power in Spain. In Ukraine, they&#39;re facing off against Russia in a conflict that&#39;s lasted 500 days so far. Closer to home, Asian Americans in the US wonder what comes next after the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action in college admissions. Also related to the US, Edward Blum succeeded in overturning affirmative action policies and now people worry if he&#39;ll turn his attention to other areas like employment. Finally, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has urged China to increase investments in climate finance while also investigating China&#39;s increasing debt crisis.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
