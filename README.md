<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening right now in the US and across the world. Former President Donald Trump&#39;s legal team is facing potential conflicts of interest, and prosecutors are asking for a protective order because of his threatening posts. Meanwhile, Clarence Thomas has a luxury RV he received from someone else&#39;s money, and it&#39;s become part of his persona. There&#39;s also tension surrounding the Virginia school district that allegedly covered up a crime to protect transgender rights. In terms of travel, there are A.I.-generated guidebooks popping up on Amazon that are misleading customers. 
On an international note, Marie-Josée Ta Lou of the Ivory Coast is trying to win her first gold medal at the 2021 World Championship this month in Budapest. Closer to home, New York City officials have cracked down on a Queens hub for Latin American street vendors who are looking for legitimization. Lastly, Huntsville experienced disappointment when it was denied its chance to host Space Command headquarters due to political reasons.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
