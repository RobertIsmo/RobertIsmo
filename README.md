<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the US White House and G.O.P. reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling for two years while cutting and capping certain federal programs. In other news, Ukraine shot down more than 40 drones over the capital in what is reported to be the largest drone attack of the war. Here at home, Democrats are debating a proposal for reparations to Black Americans and Republicans are up in arms. Additionally, France&#39;s Justine Triet became only the third woman to win the Cannes Film Festival&#39;s Palme d&#39;Or for her movie &quot;Anatomy of a Fall&quot;. Finally, Colombia&#39;s Leyner Palacios is pushing for dialogue, forgiveness and reconciliation despite receiving death threats.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
