<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s some big news coming out of Turkey. The country is headed to a presidential election runoff, and their longtime leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has shown remarkable strength. But elsewhere around the world, there are stories of people being priced out of coastal cities, educated workers seeking more affordable living options, Russian airlilnes receiving U.S.-made technology despite sanctions imposed on them, and privacy experts worrying about DNA research developments. Closer to home, President Biden is trying to work on a debt limit deal with congressional leaders while New York is dealing with crumbling garages that could be at risk of collapse. Lastly, North Carolina is facing an abortion showdown that may hinge on a single vote from the Republican-led legislature.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
