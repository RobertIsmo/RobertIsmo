<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the tech world, there has recently been a lot of finger-pointing after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. In the US, things have been pretty unpredictable lately- Chinese-brokered diplomacy has challenged US diplomatic relations in the Middle East, and the Florida governor has been accused of politicized removal of an elected prosecutor. On a more creative note, someone solved a 25 story Rubik&#39;s Cube while cities are eager to turn office buildings into housing with remote work on the rise. In other news, Russia and Ukraine have engaged in a battle for Bakhmut and New England residents are facing one of the highest heating costs in years. Finally, bystanders are stepping up to protect Black men from police brutality, while Hollywood is finally giving Judy Blume a yes after long last. And if all that news isn&#39;t enough, Duluth is becoming an attractive climate-proof city for out-of-towners.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
