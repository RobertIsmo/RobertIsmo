<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of news on a few different topics around the world right now. In the US, Harvard President Claudine Gay is facing some pressure to resign after answering questions about antisemitism. Meanwhile, Republicans are attacking elite universities for similar issues, and at Penn Vacancies in Leadership are causing anguish on campus. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in hot water over a plan to prop up Hamas, while in Gaza people are flocking to the border for safety even though it&#39;s becoming more and more dangerous. Also in the US, seized and surrendered guns are being recycled in secondary arms markets and Donald Trump is in court appealing a ruling while there are rumors of him having autocratic tendencies. In LA, there&#39;s a medical examiner&#39;s office that investigates sudden celebrity deaths and Trump is avoiding testifying in his own trial.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
