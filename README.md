<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. President Biden is facing some political fallout related to Hunter Biden, and Attorney General Garland has appointed a special counsel in response. There are also court proceedings happening involving former President Trump and the events of January 6th. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried, a cryptocurrency company owner, has been sent to jail after his bail was revoked. 

In more heartbreaking news, there&#39;s the story of Lahaina, a historic Hawaiian town that is now a ghost town with the death toll from recent disasters rising. Turning to culture, we have an interesting saga of the Jacuzzi family as well as big bucks from people spending big money on Beyoncé and Taylor Swift concerts.

Economically, China may be experiencing some declines which could pose problems for other countries; and Fox&#39;s Chief Legal Officer is stepping down after its expensive settlement with Dominion Voting Systems left many experts asking questions. Lastly, New York City is getting involved with the migrant crisis and Mayor Eric Adams is receiving pushback for his views on it.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
