<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of major developments around the world recently, especially in Gaza where China is trying to broker a peace while there have been reports of antisemitism online. In Israel, there has been an effort to draw attention to the plight of Arab Bedouins who have faced violence from Hamas too. Israel has accused Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza of concealing Hamas command centers. 

In the US, there were recent developments in Maine after a sheriff sent out a statewide alert about a gunman who had made threats against an Army base. After two days, the gunman was found dead and residents in Lewiston are trying to rebuild and cope with the traditional shooting. Separately, actor Matthew Perry died at 54. He was best known for his role in Friends, the popular NBC sitcom about a group of friends living in New York City.

Meanwhile, the UAW union recently reached a tentative deal with car manufacturer Stellantis which followed Ford&#39;s deal earlier with UAW, but they are still fighting GM over another contract dispute. In Ukraine, Kremlin&#39;s onetime pick to be their puppet leader was shot in Crimea but Moscow&#39;s invasion apparently did not succeed.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
