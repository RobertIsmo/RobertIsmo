<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey, so pretty crazy stuff has been going on lately. President Biden is proposing at least $2 trillion worth of plans to reduce deficits, mostly raised by taxing corporations and high earners. Meanwhile, House G.O.P. is prepping up to cut some federal programs while avoiding Social Security and Medicare - at the same time, chatbots are being introduced to the internet industry which might revolutionize online businesses in a good or bad way; who knows. 

In other news, Ukraine might be getting more production in artillery shells due to E.U.&#39;s plan of providing advance payments and intelligence suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group sabotaged pipelines in Europe - but still nothing concrete regarding who was responsible. 

And then on home turf, Republicans are split in opinion after reports emerged saying Fox News spread false information about the Capitol riots on Jan 6th, with Senate Republicans condemning it while some House Republican try to downplay it all. Oh, exciting times! 

Also some real estate and theater news too: one of Mayor Eric Adam’s ally just moved from City Hall to commercial real estate work, and Sondheim’s musical masterpiece is making its way back to Broadway. 

Miscellaneous news include discussions regarding Afghanistan which has suffered a lot due to the Taliban&#39;s rule resulting in many women&#39;s rights being diminished - bummer!     </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
