<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of changes happening in the US right now. Republicans are pushing for tougher abortion restrictions and new voting laws, while Democrats are trying to expand access to ballots. On top of that, tech giants like Google are laying off thousands of employees, and air travel has been increasingly malfunctioning due to FAA system outages. Additionally, culture-specific issues such as overcrowding in cram schools in India and changes to housing developments in cities across America are raising concerns over their lost charm.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
