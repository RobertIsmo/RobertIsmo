<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a hectic few weeks in the news! In the US, there are questions around the medical response to the beating of Tyre Nichols and how it connects to race and policing. Meanwhile, some states are arguing their abortion bans on constitutional grounds. In Russia and Ukraine, a battle is taking place for control of villages near the key city of Bakhmut. Kharkiv has regained some stability, but residents are still feeling the effects of the conflict. 
In sports news, there&#39;s a blossoming rivalry between Kansas City and Cincinnati to look out for in the A.F.C. Championship Game. On the health front, senior housing is becoming increasingly popular with Americans, while private equity companies are now targeting toddler gyms. Elsewhere in the world, Palestinian man was fatally shot amid ongoing violence with Israeli forces. Lastly, Novak Djokovic came full circle at the Australian Open, winning his 22nd major title.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
