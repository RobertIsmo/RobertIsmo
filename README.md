<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is still a lot of political turmoil happening in the US and around the world. Talks about raising the debt limit ended without a breakthrough. There is debate over who would be responsible for an economic collapse if a default were to happen. Biden opened a path for Ukraine to get fighter jets. 

In the US, Nebraska passed legislation restricting abortion and transgender care for minors. And there has been tension between representatives like Marjorie Taylor Greene and those from the opposing side like Jamaal Bowman. Florida&#39;s governor, DeSantis, is visiting New Hampshire to build support in the upcoming election. 

It&#39;s not all doom and gloom though. There was tribute to football great Jim Brown who passed away at age 87. His legacy includes his dominance on the field as well as his advocacy for civil rights off of it. And somatic therapy is growing with the idea that physical focus could lead to emotional healing.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
