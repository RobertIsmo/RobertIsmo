<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. President Biden is neck-and-neck with Donald Trump in a possible rematch of the 2020 election, and more Republicans are starting to admit Trump committed serious federal crimes during his time in office. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has been using the war in Ukraine to justify greater restrictions on LGBTQ life. On a lighter note in the US, there&#39;s a bus full of Mass Shooting Victims&#39; families going on a road trip to provide support for one another. And over in Europe, Germany is facing issues with unexploded wartime bombs while clever Ukrainians are carrying out drone attacks on Russian soil. Last but not least, it&#39;s summer time here in the US, and hikers in the Southwest are paying for it by experiencing several heat-related deaths in state and national parks!</p>

<h3>A Craigslist for Guns, With No Background Checks</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
