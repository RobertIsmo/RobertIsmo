<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. China and Russia are strengthening their ties, as Ukraine is running low on artillery shells and the European Union has stepped up to provide more supplies. In the US, former President Donald Trump is still trying to exert his power, while politicians surrounding him have been picking sides. The U.N Climate Panel warned that earth will reach a critical warming threshold by the early 2030s - if global cooperation and big changes don&#39;t happen. The Midwest is scrambling over politics as some pipeline projects would bury carbon underground instead of releasing it in the air. In regards to business, fate of a major bank remains uncertain as shares keep plummeting and investors worry about its effects on the rest of the banking sector. Lastly, Amazon has announced plans to lay off 9,000 employees which follows an earlier round of layoffs that impacted over 18,000 jobs.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
