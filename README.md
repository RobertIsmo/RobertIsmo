<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is a pretty chaotic place right now. We are learning more news about Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the shadowy Wagner mercenary group, after his death and a high-stakes scramble for control of his empire that&#39;s playing out on three continents. Elon Musk acknowledged withholding Starlink satellite service from Ukraine to stop an attack. In terms of the environment, countries around the world need to improve their efforts towards achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement, but unfortunately there were no bidders in Britain&#39;s offshore wind auction as costs have risen too high. 

Besides environmental news, President Biden is looking to build deeper ties with Vietnam despite authoritarian concerns and hopes to align other countries with him in curbing China&#39;s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific—two leaders (Putin and Xi) from which are absent from the G20 meeting in India. Back in America, Duke University has been noted for not having many low-income students and the College Access Index is returning to help give more economic diversity in higher education. There has also been news regarding former President Trump&#39;s allies; a Georgia panel recommended charging Senator Lindsey Graham for election interference and Peter Navarro was found guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a House investigation subpoena. Finally, there was an inspiring story about a man who turned his life around during the pandemic by creating craft hobbies which eventually blew up on social media.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
