<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. Recently, the FAA ordered airlines to ground some of their Boeing 737 Max 9 jets due to an emergency midair situation with an Alaska Airlines plane. President Trump and President Biden are having a battle for the future of democracy in the US right now. Companies are starting to reevaluate their political spending. In Michigan, Republicans are having an internal conflict that may be headed to the courts soon. The Red Sea has seen attacks on ships over the past few months and Hezbollah recently fired rockets at Israel. Technology addiction has become a real issue - people are trying to switch out their smartphones for flip phones to cut back on their usage. There&#39;s also a significant case in France where suspects from an immigrant community have been charged with murder - this has made it a cause célèbre for far-right groups. Lastly, Harvard just underwent a complicated leadership shift where Claudine Gay was removed from her post as president after facing intense pressure. On top of all this, Hollywood is debating over how to handle this awards season with people being vocal about political issues but some divisions among Hollywood personalities about the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
