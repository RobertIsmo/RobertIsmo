<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of international tensions at the moment. Russian forces unleashed missiles on Ukraine, and there&#39;s a tycoon with connections to the Kremlin who is dabbling in politics. Turkey and Syria were recently hit by a devastating earthquake, resulting in thousands of homeless people needing care. In the US, there was an incident involving a Chinese spy balloon, leading to the US blacklisting six Chinese entities that were involved in spy balloon programs. On top of all this, suicide rates have risen for some demographics and there&#39;s a chaotic political situation with the Republicans holding a razor-thin majority in the House. Lastly, sports betting has upended the economies of many Native American Tribes, and Patrick Mahomes is leading his team forward in the NFL.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
