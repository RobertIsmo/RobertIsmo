<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a pretty eventful year so far. Former President Donald Trump has been facing a lot of backlash following the report from the House Jan. 6 committee against him. In New York, a Republican Representative from New York, George Santos, is being accused of misrepresenting himself in his resume. Over in the Bahamas, there was a chaotic hearing involving Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced FTX founder, who was arrested and sent to prison last week and is now facing extradition to the US. Elon Musk asked Twitter followers if he should step down as CEO and many think that he should. In Belarus, Putin visited which has raised concerns about another Russian ground offensive near Ukraine. There&#39;s also Diane Foley who has been pushing the White House under three presidents to prioritize U.S. Hostages overseas. Chief Justice Roberts briefly suspended a decision banning border expulsions in the U.S., and Arizona&#39;s governor spent $82 million on a border wall with Mexico which his successor is calling a waste of money. Peru has faced unrest resulting in loss of tourism business for many people in Cusco who rely on it for their livelihoods. Finally, photographers this year have documented some historic moments of war, grief and wonder across the globe.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
