<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like the world is in a bit of a state at the moment. In the US, Donald Trump and President Biden are clashing over the Jan 6th events, with Trump trying to frame Biden as the one responsible. Meanwhile, former president Trump is fighting to shut down a federal election case about him, and the two top presidential candidates are sparring about social security and medicare. 

Outside of the US, tension is mounting between Israel and Gaza as Israeli airstrikes have been killing off many Gazans. In response, Hezbollah has fired rockets at Israel. In Iran too, terrorism has been on the rise recently after bombings took place, with Iran&#39;s government currently blaming Israel for it all. 

In business news, an Alaska Airlines jet that was a Boeing 737 Max 9 made an emergency landing after it unexpectedly lost part of its fuselage in midair. As a result, Alaska Airlines has had to ground its entire fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. 

Finally, Harvard&#39;s board of directors recently faced a lot of pressure which caused them to push out Claudine Gay from her role as president within a few weeks. House Republicans are also planning an inquiry into academia due to recent events. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
