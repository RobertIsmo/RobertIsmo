<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some tense international relationships, with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict still ongoing, and nations debating limits on A.I.-controlled weapons like killer drones. Technology is making waves, from Binance&#39;s founder being fined to predictions for what books may come out in 2023. In the US, former President Trump is back in the news lately, with Democrats hoping for his return to their favor and Johnson visiting him recently. On a lighter note, an overlooked photograph is getting a lot of attention and money.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
