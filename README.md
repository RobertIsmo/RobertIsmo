<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on right now in the world. Putin projected a message of power by announcing the death of his ally, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was a renegade mercenary chief and built a paramilitary force. Donald Trump recently surrendered to Atlanta Jail in Georgia as he has been charged for election interference. Nineteen people in total have been charged by the election inquiry in Georgia. The Federal Reserve&#39;s chair Jerome H. Powell is pushing for continued fight against inflation without showing signs of weakening. On the consumer side, retailers have reported worrying shifts in shopping habits. Stock market&#39;s summer doldrums may be good for the overall market, but we don&#39;t know yet. In Hawaii, officials are missing 388 people due to fires that devastated the Lahaina town. In terms of culture and art jobs, executives are compensated handsomely though housing perk being taken away from them lately. A new study has found an increase in mental health spending during the pandemic due to Americans using more remote services. Lastly, Yale students were shocked to see a safety flier with a picture of Grim Reaper on it from the campus police union who is renegotiating their contract.</p>

<h3>Why the Stock Market’s Summer Doldrums Are Not a Problem</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
