<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. In China, big companies are having to face the difficult dilemma of whether to stay or leave due to the risks involved. In the US, a court case involving Donald Trump&#39;s chief of staff was denied to move into federal court, and he is also under investigation for connections with the Capitol attack. The Supreme Court has been asked to take up a case on abortion pill availability. Elon Musk refused to help enable Ukraine perform a drone attack on Russian fleets. Nancy Pelosi said that she will seek re-election in 2024 and Joe Manchin keeps Washington guessing as he contemplates his political future. Lastly, immigration crisis have taxed resources and put pressure on President Biden to act.</p>
