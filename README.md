<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on right now around the world. In Ukraine, Ukrainian troops are fighting off Russian attacks, and they’re hoping that Western arms will help them turn the tide. Meanwhile in the US, former Vice President Mike Pence has been called to testify before a grand jury about former President Trump&#39;s attempts to stay in power after he lost the election. 

Also in the US, Joseph Tacopina was interrogating E. Jean Carroll on live TV over her accusation of rape against Donald Trump, and Carolyn Bryant Donham died at 88; her words had doomed Emmett Till years before. In Montana, a transgender lawmaker was not allowed to take their position on the House floor due to Republican lawmakers’ protests, and then the governor’s nonbinary son called on him to reject anti-trans bills they wanted to pass in the state legislature. 

At the same time, President Biden has to decide when and how to negotiate increase of the nation’s debt limit regarding a bill with spending cuts and fossil fuel support passed by Republicans, and he faces intense pressure as this is the first big decision he has to make regarding government finance. 

Finally, a UN Security Council resolution was unanimously passed that condemned Taliban&#39;s treatment of women who were prohibited from working or attending school after sixth grade, while abortion bans failed in South Carolina and Nebraska due to lack of votes from conservative state legislatures. Additionally, Afghan women who had previously fought with the US military are asking Congress for permanent legal status so they can stay in the country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
