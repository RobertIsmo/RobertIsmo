<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Around the world, things are heating up. In Ukraine, there is tension as African leaders discuss peace negotiations while missiles explode overhead. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared that Ukraine&#39;s counteroffensive has &quot;no chance&quot; at an economic forum. Closer to home in the US, the &#39;Defund the Police&#39; movement has apparently failed after activists critically fell short of building support amongst the public. Police brutality and abuse in Minneapolis have been found to have gone on for years, leading to criminal investigations against those responsible. Additionally, an ongoing investigation into documents related to former US President Donald Trump have opened new potential criminal cases. Sadly, we lost another great this week- Daniel Ellsberg, the man who famously leaked The Pentagon Papers in the early 70s. Another US associated tragedy occurred with a jury convicting a mass murderer who killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue earlier this year. Moving away from serious news and onto others areas affecting our daily lives: Chris Christie&#39;s &quot;business&quot; in making money post term as governor was discussed, and finally on TikTok users pose questions regarding alleged conspiracies behind the Titanic disaster back in 1912 caused by manipulated content. All throughout last week top players also competed for a prestige golf tournament title but not without scoring some exceptional low scores!</p>

<h3>The Business of Being Chris Christie</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
