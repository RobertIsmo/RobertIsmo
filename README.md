<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of upheaval around the world. In Israel, there was recently a very serious air attack against militants in the West Bank — it&#39;s one of the biggest they&#39;ve seen in nearly two decades. Meanwhile, Russia is ramping up its surveillance abilities to crack down on dissenters within its own borders, and Ukraine&#39;s capital city of Kyiv is under attack. People there are being provided with both physical and mental health care by emergency responders. In Canada, wildfires are taking a toll on the economy there. On top of that, people are dealing with climate change in a whole new way — they&#39;re offering cash to those who live in poorer countries before disaster strikes so they can protect themselves and their property. There have also been some ongoing tensions between hard-right Republicans and law enforcement agencies here in the U.S., who might be reined in soon by Congress. Last but not least, there&#39;s been an uptick in sales for Americana apparel like t-shirts, while dementia villages are popping up as new care facilities for those affected with dementia. Finally, it looks like the number of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border is decreasing — for now.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Dissent, Russia Seeds a Surveillance Supply Chain</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
