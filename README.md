<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some earthquakes in Turkey that have caused destruction and left rural villages struggling to survive. In China, there was a controversy over what appeared to be spy balloons being shot down by the U.S. But it later turned out to be something harmless. There&#39;s also been an interesting discussion on the changing language of hearts online as new technology emerges.

In the US, former Vice President Pence is opposing a subpoena seeking his testimony into the events surrounding the Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol. Additionally, three Americans were just arrested in connection with the assassination of Haiti&#39;s President from earlier this year. There are also rumors that Nikki Haley may be running for President against Donald Trump, and Governor Ron DeSantis is about to make a major change at a small college in Florida which has students and faculty reeling.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
