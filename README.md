<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is currently in a state of fluctuation and strife. On one hand, Chinese president Xi Jinping is engaging with the United States in an attempt to navigate frosty relations between the two countries - while also trying to assert strength. Additionally, China has strong-armed its way into dominating the South China Sea. Meanwhile, in the domestic U.S. context, House Republicans are weaponizing their spending power to try to punish the Biden administration. Further, there are tensions in Israel regarding a group of younger activists who want to be part of the discussion about peace while Israel has started blocking some Palestinian Americans from entering its borders from the West Bank.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
