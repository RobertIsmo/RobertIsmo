<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been pretty crazy all over the world lately. In the US, President Biden has been discussing potential actions against China with their leader, Xi Jinping. Meanwhile, hate speech among extremist groups has been surging both online and IRL, and university protests have broken out over the suspension of certain pro-Palestinian student groups. In Israel, inflammatory rhetoric has become more prominent due to escalating conflict between them and Gaza. Conservatives in the US are rebelling against spending bills, although they eventually backed down in one tense situation. GM workers are also protesting a tentative new contract for lacking sufficient retirement benefits. Finally, there&#39;s some shady dealings going on with FIFA and Saudi Arabia regarding a potential World Cup hosted in the kingdom, and Israeli and Palestinian teens had to put their swim club activities on hold due to the war. To top it all off, Trump is already making plans for a possible second run for president in 2025!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
