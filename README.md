<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some major events happening all over the world. In India, a tragic train crash has killed nearly 300 people with more than 2,200 onboard. In Russia, schools have begun teaching their students to focus on patriotism and the military while demonizing the West. In Ukraine, there have been explosions and both sides are preparing for a possible counterattack. In the United States, President Biden is seeking reelection and Republicans have been gathering in Iowa to discuss political issues. Canada’s military is learning survival strategies from the Inuit people in the Arctic. In Brooklyn, New York City has tried an experiment allowing residents to respond to 911 calls without police presence for five days. Activists who oppose new voting machines have been accused of being conspiracy theorists and in Florida Governor Desantis has raised a lot of funds which mostly came from big donors. Lastly, a 98-year-old former Negro Leagues star is still sharing his story and Jeff Zucker is looking to fix CNN after his departure from the role of top executive.</p>

<h3>These Activists Distrust Voting Machines. Just Don’t Call Them Election Deniers.</h3>

<h3>Could Jeff Zucker Fix CNN? He Seems to Think So.</h3>

<p>It’s been more than a year since he was forced from the top job at the network. Since then, he has made no secret of his frustrations with his exit — or his low regard for the man who replaced him, Chris Licht.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43ECvk9"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
