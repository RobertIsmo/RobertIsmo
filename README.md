<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a growing espionage shadow war between the US and China as each nation expands their global spy operations to try and gain intelligence on leadership thinking and military capabilities. US and Chinese officials met in Malta to discuss Ukraine and other issues, as the US government is trying to set up a meeting between President Biden and China&#39;s leader Xi. Meanwhile, President Trump has criticized Florida&#39;s Governor for banning abortion and Democrats are lackluster on the idea of President Biden running for re-election due to worries among voters. Sports is also at a pivotal point as there has been an unprecedented rise of female athletes over the last few years. In addition, South Korea has had to confront its past regarding an unethical adoption system, Wall Street investors are purchasing starter homes nationwide and converting them into rentals, a Yale student is facing a defamation lawsuit for accusations of rape resulting in her alleged attacker&#39;s expulsion from the university, two people have been charged with murder in a 1-year-old&#39;s death at a day care center (possibly due to opioids), thousands of religious followers are gathering in Ukraine for Rosh Hashana despite the war with Russia, and cargo ships have arrived at a Ukrainian port for the first time since Russia stopped grain trade with the country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
