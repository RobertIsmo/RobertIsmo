<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot of different things are going on in the world right now. In the United States, it looks like the Supreme Court Historical Society has been raising money from donors who want access to the Justices. Also, there was recently the release of former President Donald J. Trump&#39;s tax documents which showed that much of his income was derived from inherited assets. Furthermore, there was an arrest of a 28-year-old in Pennsylvania, charged with the gruesome killing of four University of Idaho students.

Internationally, we have seen a year of big changes in the stock market all over the world as well as Tesla stocks plummeting 65%. In Ukraine, firefighters are facing land mines and other issues while trying to fight winter conditions. On top of that, NATO head has expressed his belief that they need more arms support to combat Russia&#39;s drone swarm attacks against their energy systems and cities.</p>
