<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world are shifting and changing rapidly. Recently, China brokered a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which upended traditional alliances and rivalries within the Middle East. China is continuing to expand its global ambitions, becoming a serious challenger to the US-led world order. 

In the US, Florida governor Ron DeSantis has been politicizing his decision-making, most recently with his controversial removal of an elected prosecutor. Over in Alaska, President Biden is expected to allow an enormous $8 billion drilling project to go ahead in a large section of pristine wilderness there.

In the tech sector, Silicon Valley Bank suddenly collapsed, causing chaos for many start-ups and leaving many other companies unable to make payroll. Meanwhile there are attempts around the globe to turn water into fuel using high-tech methods. 

Outside of the US, turmoil has been growing in Ukraine where farmers have been risking their lives to harvest in fields sown with bombs. There&#39;s also a shifting battle line in the city of Bakhmut as Russia takes control of most of its east. Finally, at BBC there&#39;s been rebellion due to their decision to suspend Gary Lineker over his immigration policy criticism on social media.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
