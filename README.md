<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is intense legal and political controversy surrounding access to abortion pills and self-defense laws across the US. Recently, the Supreme Court extended a block on a lower court ruling and an abortion pill maker sued the FDA to protect its drug, if a court orders it off of the market. There have been several defamation lawsuits filed against public figures and news outlets recently too, such as Fox News, who recently settled for $787.5 million. Out of this, comes an assault on media protections that could lead to overturning of a landmark Supreme Court ruling. 

Furthermore, there has been renewed attention to shootings of people who mistakenly go to someone’s door in Missouri and New York, which has sparked talk over stand your ground laws. Internationally, Russian propaganda has become a pervasive issue in Ukraine with Russian forces causing widespread bombardment while still gaining support from citizens. On top of that, there is some drama related to Taylor Swift merchandise with fans waiting overnight in the rain outside a stadium for shirts and Governor DeSantis being heavily scrutinized over his fight with Disney.</p>
