<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on in the world right now. In the US, something tragic recently happened at a celebration - a man stormed in with a gun and opened fire and one person was killed and another is missing. In Ukraine, their leader is calling for all of the country&#39;s different regions to remain unified. In Spain, some Russian agents are suspected of directing a far-right group to mail bombs. Elsewhere in the US, educators are facing tough decisions as transgender students change gender identity and parents don&#39;t know. Closer to home, an accused terrorist is being put on trial in New York City, but he wasn&#39;t even in the city when he committed the alleged offenses. Meanwhile, the Biden administration made a mistake when they thought official files had gone to a think tank only - turns out they were still in Biden&#39;s house. Finally, millions of families are struggling as pandemic programs offering free school meals end, while food prices rise. Oh, and there was also this story about Hollywood&#39;s most reviled reporter - kind of off-topic but fascinating! And finally in sports, we saw an amazing moment when the Bengals ended the Bills&#39; season with Damar Hamlin (the Bills safety who collapsed during their previous meeting) in attendance to support his teammates.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
