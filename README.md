<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of tension in the world right now. In Washington, D.C., Russia&#39;s Embassy has become a battleground for protests between the U.S. and Russia. Meanwhile, Ukraine&#39;s nuclear plant poses a risk of danger to its neighboring countries. In the U.S., Harvard is being accused of favoring wealthy and white applicants in its admissions process, and a prestigious private school in Brooklyn is under fire after a student committed suicide after being asked to leave. Canada is facing economic damage due to wildfires, and Baltimore and Philadelphia both experienced mass shootings. There&#39;s also been an air attack on the West Bank originating from Israel recently which killed 8 Palestinians. On top of all that, the Supreme Court is confronting a conflict between First Amendment rights and gay rights with a wrong document at play. Ultimately, ultrarunning sensation Nickademus de la Rosa is taking a break due to struggling with his mental health issues.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
