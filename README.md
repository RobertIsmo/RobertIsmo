<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The Pentagon has sent U.S. arms previously stored in Israel to Ukraine, and Germany has a new untested defense minister who some are wary of. In the business world, issues over the debt ceiling are causing alarm, and lawyers are searching for FTX assets to repay customers after its collapse. Back home, Congressman George Santos was placed on two House Committees and a former candidate for New Mexico lawmaker is being charged for shooting political rivals. Additionally, in India single women face unique rental restrictions that keep them from leading economic lives, while Tesla and its C.E.O., Elon Musk, have sparked heated controversy over the accuracy of their self-driving software. Finally, candid cameras in Wisconsin have revealed that human activity may oversaturate the area with wildlife activity.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
