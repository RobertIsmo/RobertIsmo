<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world recently! In the tech space, there&#39;s been a big shake-up at OpenAI. Sam Altman, the high-profile CEO there, has been replaced by Mira Murati who was previously their CTO. There was also controversy surrounding tech mogul Elon Musk after he endorsed an antisemitic post, leading to major advertisers such as Apple and Disney cutting ties with his platform X. 

In the Middle East, New York Times journalists have recently reported on the destructive aftermath of the Israel-Hamas war in Northern Gaza. The destruction is described as houses flattened &quot;like playing cards&quot;. This has resulted in pro-Palestinian protests across New York City to call for a ceasefire. 

Back in the US, former president Donald Trump was successfully kept on the ballot despite being accused of insurrection during a district court ruling. Meanwhile Mike Johnson, who is running for Speaker of the House in the US, has been under scrutiny recently for comments he made on a prayer call where he criticized L.G.B.T.Q youth and church attendance. Additionally, Nikki Haley recently announced her support for stricter limits on abortion access during a G.O.P debate - something that could cause further polarized views in the area of abortion rights.

Finally some lighter news - Italy&#39;s Culture Ministry just opened an exhibition dedicated to JRR Tolkien with some art and acreations inspired by his works. It&#39;s certainly proving to be popular given it has even caught the interest of Prime Minister Mario Draghi! Not sure if we need any more proof that Tolkien is beloved around the world! As well as this, there was also news about singer&#x2F;songwriter Casandra Ventura reaching a settlement with music mogul Sean Combs after accusing him of rape and abuse - though terms were not disclosed. Lastly sideline reporters everywhere have been left reeling after Charrisa Thompson publicly admitted to fabricating reports during N.F.L games on Fox Sports - something which none of them expected to hear!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
