<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, there is a lot of uncertainty and change. The Fed is facing pressure to raise rates after an optimistic inflation report from October was released. Airfares are dropping due to airlines fighting for customers, and more than 400 U.S. officials have signed a letter protesting Biden&#39;s Israel policy. In addition, some Democratic lawmakers have voiced support for Johnson&#39;s plan to avoid a government shutdown, despite his previous comments about Trump being unfit for presidency in 2015. In Ukraine, officials have been indicted for levying efforts against the Bidens. Moreover, refugees returning for medical care could be taking a risky trip home from Russia, and a man convicted of journalist Anna Politkovskaya&#39;s murder was recently pardoned by Putin. Lastly, Americans are struggling with the consequences of aging and rising elder care costs with limited helpful resources available.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
