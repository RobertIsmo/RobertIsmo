<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some international news stories this week about potential military aid for Ukraine and a missile attack there that killed 11 people. In the business world, Silicon Valley is facing legal consequences for its habit of faking it, and the copyright laws for A.I.-created songs are being looked at more closely now. In the U.S., states are implementing legislation to restrict medical care for transgender adults and minors, while there is also another financial disclosure out from President Trump. To brighten things up, one arts piece discusses a beautiful 15th-century book of hours, and there is an edition of The Weekender featuring Brian Cox discussing &quot;Succession&quot;.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
