<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. A deadly earthquake recently struck a remote village in the Atlas Mountains outside of Marrakesh that knocked power and phones out, leaving survivors stranded with little access to food or water. The U.S. Open saw Coco Gauff become singles champion while allegations of inappropriate conduct by U.S.T.A. coaches towards players remain an issue. In Spain, the top soccer official resigned due to a scandal involving unwanted sexual advances, and in Missouri, an unusual phenomenon surrounding a nun&#39;s body has turned believers from all over into visitors of her abbey. President Biden continues to stand by his son Hunter as a federal investigation is underway, and Floridian Governor Ron DeSantis was seen connecting politically with Donald J.Trump at the Iowa-Iowa State game. In Massachusetts, migrant families are being placed in local towns with varying responses among citizens while some technology developed by Facebook and Google remain unreleased due to ethical considerations.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
