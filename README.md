<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. Hamas has been leaving a trail of terror in Israel and Israelis soldiers are finding evidence of the massacre of civilians by Hamas gunmen. Israel&#39;s feared security services have failed to prevent attack, prompting President Biden to condemn it as &#39;evil&#39; and &#39;abhorrent&#39;. In the midst of this conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his reputation and legacy. Meanwhile over in Gaza, airstrikes are putting civilians in danger with nowhere to hide. Closer to home, Republican congressman George Santos is facing new charges of lies and credit card fraud and there is a lack of consensus within the Republican party ahead of a speaker vote. Lastly, we are starting to learn more about the effects of remote work on our lives and economy after three years of this worldwide experiment.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
