<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the United States and around the world. In Pennsylvania, a fugitive was successfully captured after two weeks of eluding police. At the same time, Mitt Romney announced his retirement from politics and called for a ‘new generation’ of leaders to emerge beyond Biden and Trump. The House Speaker, McCarthy, reversed his stance on beginning an impeachment inquiry, which could have major consequences for the investigation. There is also an increasingly hostile situation between Putin and Kim that could escalate and bring huge repercussions. 

On the other side of things, inflation has been increasing as gas prices rise and Libya was hit with the most devastating floods in its history. This flood killed over 5,200 people and displaced 30,000 more. Lastly, a beautiful performing arts center has risen at Ground Zero in New York City while a standoff between electric vehicle workers and companies looms in the US—a test for Biden to make electric vehicles into well-paying union jobs.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
