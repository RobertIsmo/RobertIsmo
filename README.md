<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the news lately. A House panel found that the I.R.S. delayed auditing Donald Trump while he was in office, even though they were mandated to do it. Trump also paid $1.1 million in taxes during his presidency but no taxes in 2020, and a House panel released this data. Meanwhile Ukraine&#39;s President Zelensky is traveling to Washington and address Congress, and the U.S. is giving Ukraine Patriot missiles for the first time. As Covid deaths climb, even seniors are skipping the latest booster vaccine shots due to limited government support and people are expecting a holiday storm with subzero temperatures and blizzard conditions across much of the Midwest that could disrupt holiday travel plans. In Hungary, a prosperous city has dimmed its festive lighting at an annual market due to economic pain from energy costs and inflation soaring nationwide. At Berkeley Law school, there is debate over Zionism, free speech and campus ideals after one student group barred supporters of Zionism from their events. Lastly, there is a new chatbot called ChatGPT that is using artificial intelligence which could potentially replace traditional internet search engines- which raises ethical questions about how we use it responsibly without causing harm to ourselves or others.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
