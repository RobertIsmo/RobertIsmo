<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening around the world right now. Russian President Vladimir Putin is leading Russians into a conflict with the West, and there has been war in various parts of the world including the Black Sea. The Netherlands has just beat South Africa in the World Cup quarterfinals and Australia is increasing visibility and support for women in sports. In the United States, Republicans are reevaluating their &quot;war on wokeness,&quot; while Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is running for president creating tension within his political family. Also in America, Porsha Woodruff was arrested after a false facial recognition match, victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting are pushing for answers, and Donald Trump&#39;s legal team is tangled up in possible conflicts of interest. Lastly, New York Senator Schumer has used his political influence to help secure funds for semiconductors to benefit New York.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
