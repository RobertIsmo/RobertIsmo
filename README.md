<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going in the world right now. Unfortunately, the conflict between Israel and Palestine has escalated, leading to dire consequences for civilians caught in the crossfire. Over in the U.S., Nikki Haley and Robert F. Kennedy are both trying to challenge Donald Trump in the upcoming elections. In terms of business news, some companies in Vermont and England are getting into green energy projects, while Russia&#39;s economy is becoming increasingly reliant on its involvement in a war with Ukraine. Lastly, Claudia Goldin recently won a Nobel Prize for her work studying gender gaps and issues facing women in the workforce.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
