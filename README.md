<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news lately surrounding the Capitol Riot from January 6th. A panel released their final report recently, and it blamed the riot mostly on one man, likely referring to former President Donald J. Trump. It described his &quot;multipart plan&quot; to try and overturn the 2020 election. Witnesses have come forward with accounts of people trying to influence their testimonies to protect Trump. On a lighter note, it looks like many parts of the country will have a white Christmas this year! There&#39;s also news regarding an audit showing how the I.R.S. lacks resources to go after rich taxpayers, and a Ukrainian leader&#39;s unsuccessful wish list for weapons which the U.S. continues to refuse to give. In a bit of good news, Congress voted to expand U.S.&#39;s power to prosecute international war crimes, and senators have passed a $1.7 trillion spending bill which may avert another government shutdown. Furthermore, there have been investigations into Russian military identified for killing dozens in Bucha, as well as disgraced cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried being released on $250 million bond with restrictions. Lastly, even after new crypto laws related to FTX, S.E.C chair Gary Gensler sees no need for them and is warning crypto issuers and exchanges on compliance instead of legislation changes.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
