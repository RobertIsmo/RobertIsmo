<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot happening in the world. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is making some concerning attacks on domestic political opponents, raising questions about authoritarianism. OpenAI is in the middle of a diplomatic crisis - the board ousted CEO Sam Altman and now most of its staff is threatening to walk out, which could seriously damage its future operations. Microsoft&#39;s Satya Nadella is doing his part to keep their partnership going with OpenAI, though, even after the shake-up. In legal news, the Federal Court has begun to weaken the Voting Rights Act, limiting people and civil rights groups from suing under it - this will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court soon. There&#39;s also some really concerning humanitarian issues happening in Gaza right now - almost 240 people are being held hostage by Hamas and their families have no proof of life or update on their situation. And back at home in Arkansas, a state law has been passed that effectively silences pro-Palestinian speakers leaves many unable to speak out freely about their beliefs. Lastly, tech companies are facing challenges as they introduce driverless taxis - cities are dealing with an increased workload as these services have made it hard for regular employees to keep up with demand. Finally, Argentina has elected an &#39;Anarcho-Capitalist&#39; president Javier Milei who believes society works better without government interference - so that&#39;s something interesting to watch for!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
