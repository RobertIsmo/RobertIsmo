<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, a lot has been happening around the world. In the US, Speaker Mike Johnson set a collision course by splitting aide money for Israel&#39;s war efforts from aid to Ukraine. The FBI has said that the Israel-Hamas war has raised potential for attacks against Americans. Meanwhile in Europe, a Hamas assault has brought forth historic levels of antisemitism towards Jews. Posters of kidnapped Israelis have sparked a firestorm in American streets. In Maine, there is debate surrounding gun laws following a mass shooting. In Orlando, Florida school districts banned cell phones to increase student engagement. Meanwhile there is a debate about bariatric surgery as a cure for childhood obesity and home sellers won $1.8 billion in damages after realtors were found conspiring against them. Finally auto workers won big with new contracts that could set precedents beyond the auto industry.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
