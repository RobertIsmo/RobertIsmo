<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, tensions are running high between Israel and Gaza in the Middle East, as there has been an airstrike with many casualties. In the US, President Biden&#39;s approval rating has been dropping in recent polls due to weak support among younger and nonwhite voters. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, a former city council member is poised to become the first woman to lead the city. Finally, there was some good news this week as Nicolas Cage starred in a dark comedy about viral fame and runners competed at the New York City Marathon.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
