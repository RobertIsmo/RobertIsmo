<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The College Board has made changes to its A.P. curriculum for African American Studies, while Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is attempting to overhaul higher education and mandate courses in Western civilization. Meanwhile, there have been some interesting legal developments; the FBI is searching President Biden&#39;s vacation home in Delaware and Johnson &amp; Johnson is holding back payments from vaccine makers for canceled Covid shots for the World&#39;s poor. Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are also set to discuss the debt limit. Finally, sports icon Tom Brady announced his retirement after 23 seasons and seven Super Bowl wins.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
