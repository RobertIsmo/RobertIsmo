<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! We recently heard about Sam Bankman-Fried, a crypto mogul who is facing serious charges for allegedly defrauding investors out of billions. There&#39;s also been developments in the field of nuclear fusion with a research team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieving a big breakthrough. Scientists are now wondering if this could solve some of the world&#39;s climate crisis problems. In addition, here in the US, people are talking about Lauren Boebert, a far-right firebrand who won her re-election bid after a recount. There&#39;s even some fascinating stories in the sports world about how teams in the soccer World Cup rely on yerba mate for energy and how there&#39;s a whole team dedicated to interpreting famous players’ words into Arabic. All around, it looks like a busy week full of surprises!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
