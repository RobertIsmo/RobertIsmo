<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Republican politicians have been attacking elite universities for some time because of an outbreak of antisemitism, and last week a tense congressional hearing on the topic caused many on the left to join in on the criticism. As a result of the controversy, the president and chairman of the board of trustees of one of these universities (Penn) have both resigned. 

At the same time, things are heating up just outside US borders with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu working on a plan to prop up Hamas while neighboring Egypt&#39;s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has received a boost in favorability due to his involvement in the war in Gaza. 

Also in the US, local communities are inadvertently fuelling a black market for guns by giving seized and surrendered weapons to disposal services that only partially destroy them. 

Elsewhere, two American climbers from decades ago were found dead on an Argentinian glacier with an undeveloped camera containing astonishing images nearby. 

In terms of emerging trends, there is an A.I. subculture called Effective Accelerationism which strives to increase unconstrained A.I. capabilities and seems to be having an odd effect on tech movements everywhere as seen by events inside OpenAI’s Leadership Crisis. 

Finally, there are a few important stories about death going around: Los Angeles County is known as &quot;the Coroner to the Stars&quot; due to its investigations into sudden celebrity deaths, while Saudi Arabia is trying to block a U.N.-backed deal to end fossil fuels at climate summits. To counteract this lack of diversity present in these situations, Dhonielle Clayton is creating packages for commercial genre fiction featuring characters from all backgrounds.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
