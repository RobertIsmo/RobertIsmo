<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like our world is going through a lot right now. Former President Donald J. Trump recently had his bail set at $200,000 in a Georgia election interference case. In California, it&#39;s been announced that extreme drought conditions are officially gone for the first time in three years. Globally, people are worried about the possibility of nuclear war and what could happen if it becomes a reality. Politically, we&#39;re seeing big changes happening in the US with Democrats rooting for Republicans to start a debate about abortion and Chris Christie wanting to have a confrontation with Donald Trump onstage. There are also some big cases going on at the Supreme Court that could have huge implications for racial admissions standards and how Ukrainian war alliances shake out. We even have some grown-up theater kids being prominent in the world: Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Chris Christie, Senator Ted Cruz, &amp; MSNBC&#39;s Rachel Maddow, among others.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
