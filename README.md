<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of changes happening around the world right now. In Europe, the Netherlands recently experienced the collapse of their government due to disagreements over migration policy. In Spain, far-right parties have been gaining power, raising fears that their turn-of-the-century dictator might return. In Ukraine, many doctors have fled to places like Britain due to Russia&#39;s invasion, only to be unemployment upon arrival. Also, Uri Geller recently ended his grudge with skeptics after 50 years. 

On the US side, the college admissions process is under debate in light of affirmative action rulings and the cost of tuition is a concern for those seeking higher education. Meanwhile, real estate agents are vulnerable to abuse due to a lack of protections from potential clients and older Americans are facing dangerous heat waves with temperatures expected to get even worse next week.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
