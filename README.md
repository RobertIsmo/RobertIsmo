<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there are many interesting stories happening around the world. In terms of technology, real people are using AI in their everyday lives, which raises questions about authorship and ownership.  In the criminal justice system, an Airman has been charged in a major leak of classified documents. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley is facing consequences for faking it with the truth. In the art world, people are admiring a 15th-century book of hours. 

On a more serious note, several states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for minors, and Missouri is regulating medical care for transgender adults. Additionally, former US President Donald Trump has released a financial disclosure including lower-than-expected values for his social media company along with sizable bank loans. There is also an unsettling story about a former friend of the Boston Marathon bomber who still owns up to the guilt and anger he feels over knowing the &#39;monster&#39;. 

In terms of anniversaries this month, we mark 10 years since the Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and injured hundreds. Meanwhile in eastern Ukraine there has been a Russian attack that has killed nine people so far after missiles were sent into residential areas. Lastly, China&#39;s leader hasn&#39;t called Ukraine&#39;s president yet as Russia&#39;s war raises questions about their ongoing relationship.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
