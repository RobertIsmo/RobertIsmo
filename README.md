<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on around the world right now. Inflation in countries that use the euro is growing, and African migrants are heading to the US in large numbers as Europe cracks down. Meanwhile, Starbucks is being pressured over a union campaign, and some energy tanker traffic continues through the Suez Canal even after attacks there. Locally in the US, President Biden is facing pressure from both sides on immigration, and a sixth grader was killed and five others injured in an Iowa school shooting.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
