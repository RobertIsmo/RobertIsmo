<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a battle for control of a city in Ukraine called Bakhmut, and Times photographers have been there to document the fight since May 2022. Scientists have discovered a pattern in Huntington&#39;s disease in families in Colombia, but it might already be too late to be of much help. In Turkey, companies are spending a lot leading up to an election this month, and experts fear that it will bring their economy to a crisis. Royal family members are participating in a world peace program at Atlantic College in Wales in order to get hands-on experience outside of the royal lifestyle. President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy met to try and come to an agreement about avoiding defaulting on payments of the US government, but it didn&#39;t happen this time. And over in Vienna, they did something with their housing market that made it an affordable utopia compared to other places around the world. In Sudan, pregnant women are being forced to drive &quot;through hell&quot; just to reach the few hospitals that remain open and functioning. There&#39;s also an investigation into the cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried with more than 6 million pages of documents being collected as evidence. Lastly, Australia is trying to break away from becoming China&#39;s sole supplier of lithium, which is a critical battery ingredient.</p>

<h3>Sought Out by Science, and Then Forgotten</h3>

<h3>Australia Tries to Break Its Dependence on China for Lithium Mining</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
