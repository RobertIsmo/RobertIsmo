<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In Ukraine, troops are slowly advancing and aiming to gain ground on Russian targets. Meanwhile, a charity group in Ukraine hosted a wedding for two service members amidst the conflict. In South America, three Colombians were nearly killed when a missile strike hit a restaurant while they were advocating for Ukraine.  Turning to the US, former President Trump is facing new charges related to deleting documents and his campaign spending has become a mystery because most of his money goes to newly formed companies with addresses that are just Staples stores. Also in the US, Florida’s new Black history standards have sparked backlash and Senate Minority Leader McConnell’s health episode is raising questions about succession. Back in Europe, cities are relying on old methods of cooling to combat rising temperatures due to heat waves. Lastly, New York is bracing for another day of dangerously high temperatures and potentially heat-related illnesses.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
