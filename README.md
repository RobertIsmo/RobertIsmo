<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The Israel Defense Forces have recently used 2,000-pound bombs during a strike on a densely populated neighborhood of Gaza. In the US, Representative Rashida Tlaib has accused President Biden of supporting &#39;genocide&#39;. Meanwhile, in New York City, the FBI is investigating whether or not mayor Eric Adams had any involvement with fake donors. Additionally, some Louisianans are pushing their state Democratic party to confront internal divisions and inadequate donations. On top of that, Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert is facing increasing backlash from her own party, and elections in Kentucky, Ohio and Virginia may offer clues to how abortion will shape the 2024 elections. In New Jersey, Republicans are trying to cut into Democratic majorities within the state Legislature come Election Day. Additionally, Amazon’s drone project is delivering small objects, including cans of soup. Finally, there&#39;s also a defamation case against a former president and some new provisions for mothers preparing to take part in the NYC marathon.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
