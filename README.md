<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>Things in the world have been a bit chaotic lately. There&#39;s been a lot of suffering at the US-Mexico border, where Mexico is facing a logjam of desperate migrants coming from the US and other countries. In the US itself, Donald Trump is under investigation for hush-money and there&#39;s a ruling for Vice-President Pence to testify to a grand jury related to the January 6th Capitol riots. An impactful shooting occurred in a Nashville school and an Israeli government plan to restructure its judiciary has caused turmoil. As if all this isn&#39;t enough, Carlos Moreno, a professor behind an important urban planning concept has been receiving death threats and US bank executives have come under scrutiny with potential reviews on the horizon. Finally, some inhabitants in Ukrainian towns destroyed by shelling are refusing to evacuate their homes in spite of danger.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
