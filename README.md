<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of beautiful chaos happening in the world. In the United States, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was acquitted in a landmark Senate trial by a largely party-line vote after being impeached on charges of corruption and abuse of office. Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers union is resuming talks with three Detroit automakers, while tech fears are showing up on union picket lines. In Russia, the effects of a war are ever-present but its dangers have yet to disrupt daily life. Additionally, countries surrounding Ukraine have placed restrictions on Ukrainian grain sales. Moving onto sports, one college football player who experienced chaotic conditions at his previous school has found success in major college football. Moreover, there has been a tragedy at a Bronx day care facility where a 1-year-old boy died and three other children were hospitalized after opiod exposure. On top of that, controversy is brewing in Aurora Colorado centering around police regulations after Elijah McClain&#39;s death in 2019. Lastly, fears regarding global warming and environmental crises have gained attention after the summer saw intense heat waves, fires, and floods.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
