<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, they recently shot down a missile fired by Russia with the help of US-made artillery. Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine are both feeling pressure from their respective Western and Eastern backers. In Russia, a prominent nationalist writer was injured in a car bombing. On Saturday, Charles III was crowned king in the UK after 70 years of no monarchs - there were some traditional elements with some modern touches at the ceremony. We also saw distance between the brothers William and Harry during the coronation, who usually have a close relationship. Closer to home, authorities in Georgia are currently investigating whether Donald Trump interfered with their election while they also have 9 people who received immunity deals for pretending to be electors during his campaign. In New Hampshire some residents still bewitch over the collapsed rock formation that existed since 2003. Finally, there&#39;s quite a bit happening in sports too where we&#39;ll see Stephen Curry vs LeBron James for the playoffs - possibly for their last time together - redefining basketball for this generation. Oh, and there&#39;s also energy crises due to extreme weather changes caused by climate change which prevent access to generators and batteries for many people.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
