<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of political upheaval happening in the US right now. The House just passed a debt limit bill in a bipartisan vote, to try and avert default. There is an ongoing investigation into former President Trump for mishandling sensitive documents. Another investigation is looking into security footage taken by some of Trump&#39;s aides relating to documents. In Russia, West is being denounced over a drone strike on Moscow. In Iowa, Florida Governor DeSantis is signaling a &#39;slugfest&#39; with former President Trump. And there&#39;s a long-standing and unresolved problem with radioactive waste from making bombs that&#39;s costing $528 billion to clean up, without any resolution yet. Texas Governor named an interim Attorney General after Ken Paxton was impeached. Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled new abortion bans unconstitutional and there was a legal case involving actor Danny Masterson convicted of raping two women that had been discouraged by Scientology. Lastly, Turkey&#39;s President Erdogan has recently been re-elected and he&#39;s been vilifying LGBQT people in his speeches which has made them feel threatened and alone.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software.
