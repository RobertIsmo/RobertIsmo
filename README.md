<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The US is facing a government shutdown because of opposition to McCarthy&#39;s plan, and the national debt has just topped $33 trillion. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is accusing Indian officials of killing a Canadian citizen who supports an independent Sikh nation. In Africa, Ghana is seeking its 17th financial rescue from the IMF due to a crisis of debt and bailout issues. The United Nations is trying to resolve international tensions and disagreements over climate change and other development goals. On the Iran front, President Trump agreed to unfreeze billions in oil revenue to Tehran in exchange for the release of 5 American prisoners. Police have arrested a suspect in the ambush shooting of a Los Angeles County Deputy. Finally, scientists have been looking at ways to tell if artificial intelligence can become conscious.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
