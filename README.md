<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot going on in the US. Over the weekend, Congress passed a bill last minute to prevent a shutdown of the government with help from House Democrats. A congressman pulled an actual fire alarm in one of the office buildings before they voted, and two investigations have been opened as a result. In addition there is an ongoing fight over Ukraine aid from right-wing Republicans. 

In California, Senator Feinstein&#39;s death recently occurred and this has sparked debates on filling her seat - Governor Newsom promising to choose a Black woman for the spot but none of the current Democrats running for Senate. 

The war between Ukraine and Russia for more deadly flying machines is intensifying along with their competition to win global electronic supply chains. Texas has even joined in by putting on extravagant mums for homecoming events - a far cry from simple chrysanthemum corsages! 

Meanwhile, researchers have uncovered that a race massacre in Atlanta against Black residents overlooked back in 1906 played a role in its evolution whether people knew it or not. New York City continues to recover from floods caused by climate change and those who tackle falsehoods online are realizing their efforts are slowing down. 

To top it off, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel just reached his 20th year of power and many trace current conflicts back to him. All this happening at once!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
