<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is growing scrutiny of cultural expression in China, where a comedian was recently investigated and performances were cancelled across the country. Meanwhile, a new report has revealed that employees of the popular app TikTok share users&#39; private information, such as licenses, photos, and addresses. 

In the US, federal spending paths are threatened by a potential debt ceiling deal and House Speaker McCarthy has called for government spending cuts. Treasury Secretary Yellen warns of missed payments if the ceiling is not lifted and a Texas GOP split has broken out with accusations of drunkenness. Meanwhile, Ron De Santis&#39; power grabs as Florida governor and his plan to amass $200 million to beat Donald Trump in 2024 presidential elections have been making news headlines. 

At home in New York City, we&#39;re seeing conflict between a financier and hedge fund mogul over SoHo rooftop renovations as well as an impending homelessness crisis several months after Mayor Eric Adams&#39; housing official resigned. 

On the international level, Russians have spilled so much blood trying to seize control of Ukraine&#39;s city Bakmut that analysts think Russia&#39;s exhausted forces will settle into a defensive rule in preparation for Kayr&#39;s counteroffensive. 

Finally, there&#39;s some exciting news in science - a paralyzed man can walk again with implants connecting his intentions to physical movements!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
