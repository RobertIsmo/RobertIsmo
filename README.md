<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the world is going through some big changes. In China, its population is dropping and its economy fell short of Beijing’s goal last year due to Covid lockdowns. In the Caucasus, there&#39;s a new conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that Russia has not been able to intervene in due to being distracted and weakened in Ukraine. In Florida, they&#39;ve implemented &#39;red flag&#39; gun laws to prevent school shootings. Universities are revamping their teaching methods to address popular AI chatbots. In Arizona, people are living without running water due to drought conditions in the West. At Rikers Jail, investigators of sick leave abuse have been unable to work due to high attendance of officers lying about being sick. There was an attempted shooting targeting New Mexico Democrats by a Republican ex-candidate. And finally, there was a near-miss at JFK due to one plane taking off when another was crossing its path.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
