<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are busy and changing rapidly across the world right now. In Turkey, tens of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have relocated to resort town Antalya to avoid the fallout of Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine. In New York, religious schools are getting a lot of special education funding, but there&#39;s some concern that the funds aren&#39;t being used as effectively as they could be. In Long Island, George Santos, a Republican representative-elect, is in trouble after it was revealed he lied about his educational history and professional background on the campaign trail. In Buffalo and much of the South there have been extremely cold temperatures, causing weather-related disruption like broken pipes and municipal water system failures. Southwest Airlines has recently been in a lot of trouble too--they had to cancel thousands of flights after a winter storm, and many more recently due to operational issues that emerged during the storm. China has responded with a collective shrug to an American Covid testing rule. Last but not least, Jason Lentz is becoming a world-class competitive lumberjack--it must run in his family!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
