<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now a lot is going on in the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin has promised free grain to African countries at a summit in an attempt to improve Russia&#39;s image. On the business front, people seem optimistic that the US economy may be slowing down without entering into recession. The Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Memphis police after the beating of Tyre Nichols and the Trump investigations are continuing as potential criminal charges looms over former president Trump. Climate wise, July appears to be breaking all records for warmth and the Northeast is seeing higher temperatures. On a lighter note, we&#39;ve been hearing about Frank Kozik, punk rock legend, as well as tech moguls like Elon Musk trying their hands at all-in-one apps and Twitter celebrities making an appearance on Threads. Finally, Lindsey Horan stood out at the World Cup with a goal scored out of anger.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
