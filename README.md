<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve been keeping up with the news lately, and here&#39;s what I can tell you. There seems to be a lot going on in the US with people losing Medicaid coverage since pandemic protections expired, and there have also been reports of fraudulent activity going on around stimulus programs like the Employee Retention Credit. There&#39;s also a potential deal being worked on between the White House and the GOP to raise the debt limit and cut spending. Overseas, there are elections taking place in Turkey, and President Erdogan is campaigning to be re-elected with promises to lead Turkey to being a global superpower. In Germany, they’re discussing whether or not Ukraine should be allowed to enter NATO for similar reasons. In real estate, it looks like the Hamptons is losing its cool with younger people due to housing rules and costs. Lastly, there appears to be some reckoning going on for JPMorgan due to its long ties with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
