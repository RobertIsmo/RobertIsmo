<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there was a major dam disaster and thousands of people are being evacuated. The US is seeing an increase in attacks from Russia, and Prince Harry is taking on British tabloids for years of media scrutiny. In Oklahoma, the first religious charter school was approved, but this could lead to a legal battle over church and state. Meanwhile, movie theaters around the world are hoping to woo back customers by updating their features with larger screens, heated seats, and even sushi. Ex-Vice President Mike Pence has entered the 2024 presidential race against former boss Donald Trump. Former Governor Christie of New Jersey is also trying to join the race as he&#39;s seen as a &#39;Trump slayer&#39;. Robert Kennedy Jr., who surprisingly has high poll numbers in the Democratic primary, has been pushing right-wing ideas and misinformation about mass shootings and border control. Robert Hanssen was recently revealed as supplying confidential information regarding the US government to Moscow and sentenced to life in prison. Lastly, Trump&#39;s lawyers visited the US Justice Department as part of their investigation into classified documents. Trump also asked for a judge to stop Carroll from suing him for second defamation due to a jury finding him liable for sexually abusing her. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
