<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension in the US regarding the debt limit deal. The GOP is revolting against it, but Congressional committees have voted to move the bill forward towards a House vote. There&#39;s also controversy surrounding the debt limit agreement and its provision that orders federal agencies to issue permits for the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which environmentalists are up in arms about. Republican presidential candidate Ron Desantis has also put pressure on Trump regarding this deal. 

In Russia, a drone strike has made the war in Ukraine feel much more immediate as it prompted questions about Russian air defenses. 

The Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma are being shielded from opioid liability after an Appeals Court ruling that will now result in billions of dollars being released from their fortune to help with addiction related costs. 

Meanwhile, scientists are lugging sophisticated sensors into homes in 10 cities to measure and track pollution from gas stoves as it drifts from room to room. There&#39;s also been a lot of protest surrounding a collapsed building in Davenport, Iowa, as people remain unaccounted for. 

A fight between progressive newcomers and nostalgic old-timers arose in Berkeley this summer due to plans to build apartments. 

Also, Elizabeth Holmes was just sentenced to 11 plus years in prison for fraud concerning her blood testing start up Theranos. 

Lastly, A.I leaders are warning that future systems could be as deadly as pandemics and nuclear weapons while an octopus-like creature called a shogoth symbolizes the current state of A.I.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
