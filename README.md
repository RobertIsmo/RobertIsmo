<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, banks that were at the center of the recent financial crisis are grappling with their place in the market. Higher interest rates are leaving borrowers with bigger bills on credit cards, student loans and other forms of debt, while savers benefit from higher yields. A judge in a case involving former US President Donald Trump is under scrutiny for her past rulings favoring him. The GOP contenders see this as a problem, as it&#39;s consuming news cycles and taking attention away from their campaigns too. Fox News Chyron called president Joe Biden a &#39;wannabe dictator&#39;, while the US is paying billions to Russia&#39;s nuclear agency as nuclear power companies rely on enriched uranium made in Russia for emissions-free energy. Ukraine is on the offensive but progress measurement is still difficult. Battle rap is an art form, industry and sport centered around New York, while Southern Baptists just reaffirmed their stance against female pastors. Finally, there&#39;s been a retrospective resurgence over Cormac McCarthy&#39;s works, as the last of generation of writers who redefined American prose.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
