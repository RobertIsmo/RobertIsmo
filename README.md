<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot of tensions around the world are escalating right now. In Israel, there is an emotional trauma affecting the country following a Hamas attack and abduction of hostages. On top of that, a Russian warship in Crimea&#39;s occupied waters has been damaged by a Ukrainian missile strike. Meanwhile, in Iraq, US strikes targeted Iran-backed groups after an attack hurt three Americans. There are also disputes between Turkey and other NATO members over Sweden&#39;s request to join NATO. Besides all this, there have been significant developments in businesses, art and culture - such as holiday spending increasing despite fears of a decline, back to photos that defined 2023 in arts and the top business stories of the year. Lastly, Trump seems to be planning for his 2025 trade agenda with higher tariffs on imports from China.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
