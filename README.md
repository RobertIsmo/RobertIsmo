<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot happening in the world. In the U.S., the House Ways and Means Committee is about to vote on making Trump&#39;s taxes public, and that decision could set off a battle between the Democrats and Republicans. There was also a 6.4-magnitude earthquake in Northern California, Wells Fargo was fined $3.7 billion over consumer banking violations, and Congress just proposed a spending bill to avoid a shutdown. 

In Britain, there are long waits with ambulance services due to an NHS (National Health Service) crisis, and striking nurses, emergency responders, and rail workers are causing disruptions in travel and services in the holiday season. 

Finally, something a bit more positive: There was good news for California as they were able to avoid another year of catastrophic wildfires.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
