<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Worldwide, things have been pretty wild lately. In the US, President Trump has been indicted by a grand jury on 34 counts of major felonies connected to an illegal hush-money payment to a porn star before the 2016 election. In Europe, Finland has become NATO&#39;s 31st member after years of diplomatic tensions between Russia and Ukraine. In terms of health, experts are saying that drinking any amount of alcohol won&#39;t benefit your health - in fact it can actually increase the risk of developing certain illnesses or conditions. And then there&#39;s the upcoming Wisconsin Supreme Court race - this election could determine if abortion remains illegal and how the state&#39;s maps will be redrawn for the future. On the cultural side, Johnson &amp; Johnson has struck a deal for an $8.9 billion talc settlement due to lawsuits claiming its products caused cancer. And on Broadway, composer John Kander is launching his 16th musical which is set in New York City! It&#39;s also springtime in Australia which brings us to Hot Cross Buns - apparently they&#39;re like the Pumpkin Spice Latte there right now. Finally, opinion-wise, people are saying that Donald Trump&#39;s case against him looks really strong - nothing novel or weak about it at all.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
