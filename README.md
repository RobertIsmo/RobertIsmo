<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Congress member Jamaal Bowman recently pulled a fire alarm in a House office building ahead of a rushed vote on a stopgap funding measure, and two investigations have been opened in the incident. Also, former President Jimmy Carter&#39;s birthday celebration was postponed due to the potential government shutdown, but people still showed up to play games and eat cake despite it all. 

In California, Senator Dianne Feinstein&#39;s recent death has intensified the fight for her coveted Senate seat. Governor Gavin Newsom has pledged to pick a Black woman to fill the seat instead of choosing from any of the current Democrats running for it. In addition, there has been an interesting history of consequential deaths in Congress that could be important given that the Senate is aging and narrowly divided right now. 

Over in Ukraine, they are in the midst of a war with Russia and have been dealing with a contest over drones and global electronics supply chains running through China. Meanwhile, here in Texas, cheerleaders and football players aren&#39;t the only ones getting ready for homecoming as moms have been working hard to create elaborate mums for their kids. 

Back in academia, Harvard professor Francesca Gino was recently accused of falsifying data about how to stop dishonesty, which caused quite a stir in behavioral science. 

On the East Coast, New York City is lurching back to life after intense floods recently forced its transit systems to shut down. Plus, fact-checkers have noted that progress in fighting online falsehoods has plateaued and started to slow down. 

Finally, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has held power as prime minister for two decades now; analysts are pointing out how his outsize personality has had both large and small impacts on the crisis his nation currently faces. And speaking of crises, many people are starting to notice how New York galleries moving into gentrifying neighborhoods such as Soho causes waves (in more ways than one) of economic changes that affect locals.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
