<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few big stories happening around the world right now. At the NATO summit, the alliance added Sweden and laid out plans for long-term support to Ukraine, although Kyiv wanted more. President Biden is vowing that NATO would oppose Russian aggression for as long as needed, making it seem like a Cold War parallel. In the US, House Republicans are trying to undermine the legitimacy of FBI with former President Trump&#39;s help. In Vermont there was a storm that tested the success of new flood defenses, and Chicago residents needed to take shelter after a tornado warning. There is also a dangerous heat wave forecasts in the South that could last for weeks or longer. Additionally, Emmy nominations have been announced with HBO&#39;s &#39;Succession&#39; getting 27 nods and &#39;Ted Lasso&#39; getting 21 - though it may be delayed due to a writers’ strike. The list of Emmy nominees have also been released, but there were some unexpected snubs and surprises. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
