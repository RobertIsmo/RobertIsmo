<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on in the world right now! In Ohio, Republican legislators are trying to amend the state constitution through an election. Florida Governor DeSantis recently acknowledged that Trump lost the 2020 election. There&#39;s also a legal case stemming from the Capitol siege on January 6th. Trump has tried to throw out a countersuit against his accuser E. Jean Carroll and his lawyer deemed his effort to overturn the election &quot;aspirational&quot;. Interest rates are high, there&#39;s a new cryptocurrency project trying to scan billions of human irises, and there is evidence of growing plastic pollution in the oceans. Meanwhile, China&#39;s military power is undergoing a shake-up that is threatening its image. Lastly, the Audubon Society is facing controversy over its ties to slavery in relation to social justice issues.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
