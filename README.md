<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy week in world news. In China, the head of their airship program has announced that they sent one over North America in 2019, which has led to increased tensions with Washington. Meanwhile, there have been multiple shootdowns in North American airspace of mysterious craft, prompting investigations from both the US and Canada. China claims the US regularly sends experimental balloons into their airspace. Over in Russia, soldiers captured by Ukraine have recounted being used as cannon fodder by commanders during assaults. In Turkey, survivors and building experts are scrutinizing a construction amnesty after an earthquake that killed over 33,000 people.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
