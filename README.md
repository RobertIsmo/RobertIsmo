<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of conflict happening in the world right now. In Gaza, Israeli troops have entered a ground operation and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a war at home and abroad. In the US, there was recently a mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, but people are coming together to mourn, despite still being under lockdowns. Donald Trump is also facing a fraud trial and his children are taking the stand this week. In New York City, we recently got an extremely detailed map of local neighborhoods and there&#39;s a new article about how shipping contributes to climate change and if green ships can be the solution. Lastly, Matthew Perry recently passed away at the age of 54 and there&#39;s an article reflecting on his life.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
