<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like we may be able to avoid another government shutdown, but there could still be some economic risks long term if it isn&#39;t resolved soon. Oil prices have been rising with some analysts suggesting they could reach $100 a barrel soon. The legal troubles of former president Donald Trump are now being put in the spotlight, with a judge having determined he committed fraud in valuing his properties. New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez is facing bribery charges that could end his career, and the ruling on that is expected soon. Additionally, Azerbaijan recently seized Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian control in an unexpected development.

On the tech side, European companies are being forced to adopt new policies to help curb the spread of disinformation while Jeff Bezos faces a real challenge from the head of the Federal Trade Commission over his company Amazon&#39;s practices. In terms of health, nursing homes are still waiting for vaccines as rates of Covid infection rise. And finally, three black women are working to preserve desecrated African American burial grounds in Georgia, Texas and Washington D.C, which contain important stories and history.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
