<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In US politics, there&#39;s a Republican representative from Louisiana, Mike Johnson, who is playing a pivotal role in congressional efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. And speaking of elections, Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney in Georgia is using plea deals to build momentum in her case against Donald Trump and his associates. On the global scene, we&#39;ve been hearing more about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza in light of ongoing bombings by Israeli forces as well as a powerful hurricane that caught many by surprise. In the tech world, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX crypto exchange is facing trial for fraud and gets to take the witness stand this week. Closer to home here in New York, a high-rise luxury tower is blocking views of the Empire State Building and outdoors you might run across an unexpected addition toNYC sidewalk sideshows--a lady with two goats who has a story of despair to tell. Oh! And there&#39;s also news of Scholastic backtracking on isolating works on race and gender-- apparently they were doing it in order to help schools navigate new laws restricting books about racism and LGBTQ identities. Crazy times!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
