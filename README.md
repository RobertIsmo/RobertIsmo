<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now we&#39;re seeing a lot of violence between Israel and Hamas. The U.S. is urging the world to back Israel&#39;s actions in Gaza, while the civilian toll of dead and wounded keeps increasing. Meanwhile in Congress, Republicans are voting for new House Speaker, though many of them are reluctant due to internal disagreement about the nominee. Other news around the world includes a British singer becoming a &quot;sewage czar&quot; for his country, France raising its terrorist threat level after another terrifying stabbing attack, and doctors at one health care system joining forces in a union. On the culture front, Nobel-winning poet Louise Glück has died and Taylor Swift&#39;s concert movie has been released a day early!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
