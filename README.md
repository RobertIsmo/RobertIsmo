<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like inflation is slowing down and giving shoppers some discounts, but homeownership could be an out-of-reach goal for many young Americans. On Wall Street, the Fed&#39;s dovish forecast about interest rates has led to a new record high for the S&amp;P 500, though not everyone is convinced this rally will last. We got an inside look at how the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, and there&#39;s been no relief in sight for Ukraine in terms of much-needed economic aid. Some Ukrainian men have reported incidents of wrongful draft notices and coercive mobilization tactics as recruiters attempt to fill army ranks. One former hostage recently released after a 7-week ordeal shared her story of terror and tears. Meanwhile, peace activist couples in Israel have been fractured by the conflict, leaving one side wondering if they ever really understood each other. It has been a tumultuous year in Congress, with Republican retirements leading to potential shakeup come 2024 elections - and Democrats facing possible challengers backed by AIPAC are represented by Rep. Ilhan Omar. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
