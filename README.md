<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot going on in the world. In Ukraine, small tech start-ups are using the war as an opportunity to demonstrate their military systems and the US government is providing aid to help in the conflict. Russia recently imposed sanctions on US officials, many of whom were seen as adversaries by former President Donald J. Trump. Meanwhile, the US is trying to secure critical minerals necessary for its energy transition through a variety of agreements. There is also unrest in Afghanistan as some have attempted to cross a jungle in search of safety after being left behind by the US withdrawing from Kabul. In Greece, New Democracy party secured enough seats ahead of elections to move forward without creating a coalition, setting the stage for another vote in weeks. Lastly, in the US, President Biden and Republican leader McCarthy have been negotiating debt limit issues, with financial markets uncertain of what will come following their discussions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
