<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. Police departments in the US are dealing with a wave of resignations, which started during the pandemic and last year&#39;s civil unrest, and are having to resort to offering bonuses and attention to recruits. In Buffalo, there was a blizzard that has trapped people in their homes and cars without heat, resulting in 17 deaths. There was also a tragic bus crash in Canada on Christmas Eve which killed 4 people and injured dozens more. A South Korean tour group got stranded near Buffalo as well. Internationally, there was a fascinating story about how citizen spies foiled Putin&#39;s grand plan for one Ukrainian city. 

In Memphis, high schools are introducing new phonics literacy lessons into their classes and King Charles III is taking steps to make his monarchy more inclusive. In Britain, there is an interesting story about a bridge that keeps getting crashed into by vehicles resulting in cargo such as flowers and potatoes being spread around the roadway! On top of all this, we&#39;ve had some great TV episodes this year, easy recipes for holiday desserts and plenty of great air-fryer recipes if you happen to have got one for the holidays. We&#39;ve also seen fashion and sports joining together in a big way this year and creating massive business opportunities.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
