<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of stories in the news lately about social and political issues around the world. In the US, migrant children are being exploited for their labor, often in dangerous situations and sometimes making products for well-known brands. In Nigeria, voters are hoping for a leader who can restore their economy after many years of dashed hopes in the presidential election this weekend. Meanwhile, tensions between major economies rose at the G20 summit because of conflict in Ukraine. Tech companies are cutting back on office space with so many working remotely now, leading to a booming secondhand furniture market. And extreme weather is also causing damage in California - snow and flooding up high and down low. Plus, content creators who went viral are now having to figure out taxes due to their newfound success!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
