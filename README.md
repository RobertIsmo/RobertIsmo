<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like global politics and economics are constantly evolving.  In the US, President Biden is hosting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while pushing democracy concerns to the background. Business leaders are also welcoming Modi&#39;s visit, noting India&#39;s fast-growing economy. Britain&#39;s inflation rate remains stuck at 8.7 percent, which is causing some concern about a cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile, former President Trump has influenced the evolution of the Republican Party, calling into question a post-Watergate norm. Finally, New York City leaders are racing to regulate battery-powered mobility devices due to over 100 fires this year.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
