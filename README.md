<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of tensions in the world right now. In Ukraine, 18 months of war have left no lasting ground gained by either side despite both sides making large offensives. In the US, vulnerable Republican representatives are trying to avoid blame if the government shuts down on September 30th. Meanwhile, Trump&#39;s lawyers are being accused of dragging their feet for his trial on charges of mishandling classified material and obstructing justice. Newcomers continue to arrive in New York, forming new communities in what can be hostile environments. Lastly, Beyonce had a successful Renaissance tour that showed the power of pleasure cultivation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
