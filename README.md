<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of troubling events currently happening in the world. Currently, many countries and communities are experiencing the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and medical workers are facing increasing strain with each passing day. Protests and demonstrations have also been taking place around the world to fight against police brutality and systemic racism. Additionally, there have been recent scandals relating to corporations, governments, and celebrities. All of these issues present difficult challenges, but they also give us hope that we can bring about positive change in 2021.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
