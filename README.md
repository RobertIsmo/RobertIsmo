<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In China, there&#39;s an ongoing real estate crisis that is making it difficult for the government to resolve. In the United States, distrust of China is leading to restrictions placed on Chinese businesses, and the US Commerce Secretary will be visiting next week to try and steady relations. The BRICS Club of emerging nations is debating whether or not to let new members in, while Republican presidential hopefuls will face off in a televised debate without Donald Trump. Poland&#39;s northern border area has been shrouded in fear due to potential invasion, there are deeper conversations being had about sexual assault and rape, a wheelchair football team in Buffalo is providing players with community and purpose, and some residents of the Texas border are having second thoughts regarding Governor Abbott&#39;s crackdown on migrants. Lastly, US airline companies have had multiple close calls between planes that were previously not known. And in Pakistan, a cable car malfunctioned while taking students to school, leaving them dangling for hours.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
