<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there has been a historic vote to oust a serial fabulist from Congress. There have also been court cases involving former president Trump and late Supreme Court justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Elsewhere, there has been an attempt by protesters to set fire to the Israeli Consulate in Atlanta and actress Susan Sarandon recently apologized for comments made at a rally. On the climate front, several countries have pledged to increase their nuclear capacity in order to reduce fossil fuel emissions and the Biden administration is pushing for a powerful regulatory tool aimed at climate change. Lastly, Japan has implemented new regulations to keep people from giving their children unusual names. All in all, it&#39;s an eventful time!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
