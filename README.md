<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The US reached a deal with Iran to free five American detainees in exchange for Tehran gaining access to $6 billion for humanitarian purposes and the US freeing some Iranians. On the legal side of things, the Supreme Court paused an opioid settlement with the Sacklers and Donald Trump and his longtime aide plead not guilty to new charges in documents case. President Biden is trying to pass a bill for another $24 billion for Ukraine and Russia is allegedly using drones against them. In New York, there&#39;s a strange defamation lawsuit between a wealthy teenager who was turned away from a bar in a 5-star hotel, and the hospital research trials at Columbia were suspended after a subject&#39;s suicide. Lastly, we&#39;re celebrating hip-hop&#39;s 50th anniversary this week as it has become an all-encompassing force around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
