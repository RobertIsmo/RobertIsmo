<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are pretty tense in Israel right now with Prime Minister Netanyahu attempting a difficult juggling act to keep both his far-right coalition and public opinion happy. In the US, President Biden is putting pressure on the Israeli government to abandon its plan to weaken the judiciary, and there was a tragic shooting at a Christian school that left six dead. Further away, China is giving huge loans to other countries and coming up as an important lender of last resort alongside groups like the IMF, while in Ukraine nuclear safety concerns have brought UN officials onsite. On a lighter note, South Carolina just made its third straight run to the Final Four in college basketball and North Carolina has decided to expand Medicaid after Republicans abandoned their opposition. Lastly, Rolling Fork, Mississippi is hoping for a full comeback after a tornado ravaged the town, with local officials vowing they will come back better than ever.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
