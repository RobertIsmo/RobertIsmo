<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of serious issues happening around the world right now. In the US, there is a controversial story about police brutality when arresting Tyre Nichols and two emergency medical technicians being charged with failing to provide aid. In Europe, the US is pushing its partners to weed out illicit trade with Russia and there are growing tensions with China over a giant balloon appearing in the US that has raised a lot of questions for people. There is also lots of news about Austria, where the law favors light-colored local bees, and those honey producers judged “too dark” risk eradication. Finally, in India, one of the country’s tycoons, Gautam Adani, has seen his fortunes unraveling.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
