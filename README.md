<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. On Wall Street, the biggest banks are propping up Teetering First Republic with a $30 billion infusion. Low rates were expected to last for years but with Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s implosion, finance is beginning to feel the pinch. In France, President Macron is facing backlash for pushing through a law raising the retirement age without parliamentary support and his opponents are singing and banging against it. Over in North Dakota, the Supreme Court is blocking an abortion ban and saying it violates the constitution. Kamala Harris was in Iowa saying Republicans won&#39;t be done with opposing abortion once it&#39;s overturned. In the NCAA tournament, Princeton just achieved an upset by beating Arizona and it commemorates a long-time upset win over UCLA in 1996. Poland is getting involved in Ukraine now, saying they&#39;ll arm them with warplanes to ward off Russian forces. The Biden Administration wants TikTok to find a buyer or face a ban and that may not be so easy because of complications. Last but not least, scientists and musicians are recording the melting of ice to document climate change which might help slow it too if their work is successful.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
