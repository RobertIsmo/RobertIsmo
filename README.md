<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is increasing economic instability in China combined with a lack of faith in the future, prompting the Federal Reserve&#39;s head to make a speech about keeping inflation in check. Consumers here in the US are beginning to show signs of stress, a reflection of shifting shopping habits. Wall Street had a brief spell of turbulence this summer, but some are arguing that this might ultimately be a good thing. In Russia, outspoken oligarch and ally to President Putin Yevgeny Prigozhin passed away in a mysterious plane crash and some see it as being an indicator of how the Kremlin deals with disloyalty. Ukraine is actively responding to Russian aggression by launching drone strikes, sending a strong message to its citizens that they are not powerless. Former American president Donald Trump is embroiled in an expansive legal inquiry related to alleged election interference in Georgia; there were 19 people charged in total. Hawaii authorities have released a list of 388 people who are missing following devastating bush fires in Maui. The Director of the British Museum stepped down after an employee was fired for stealing from the museum. And finally, the head of Spanish Soccer has refused to resign after he made a kiss gesture toward a winning Spanish women’s soccer team member during an awards ceremony.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
