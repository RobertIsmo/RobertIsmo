<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there are reports of drone attacks on targets inside Russia, including Moscow. A judge has rejected Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to challenge an investigation into the election in Georgia. Trump&#39;s own property manager was indicted on charges related to carrying classified material and his legal woes are only getting worse. Meanwhile, a poll shows Trump crushing GOP rivals in Florida, leading Ron DeSantis to make an economic plan for blue-collar voters. Climate change is causing coral reefs to suffer in Florida, while Phoenix experienced 31 days of extreme heat. Paul Reubens, the creator of Pee-wee Herman, died recently at the age of 70 and Italy has fallen for a steamy new TV show. Additionally, the Women&#39;s World Cup 2023 rules on advancing teams to the knockout round have been released and California is clearing homeless camps without providing much help in solving homelessness.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
