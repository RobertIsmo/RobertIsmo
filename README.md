<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on all over the world - from political and economic developments to climate change. In the US, the House has passed a resolution to formally begin an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, while the Senate has managed to pass a defense bill without restrictive policy dictates, but still has a mountain of spending legislation left to do. In other world news, Russia&#39;s President Putin said that his war aims haven&#39;t changed in his annual press conference, and Israel and Hamas have been involved in a war that is tearing apart public defenders in the Bronx. On top of all that, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell&#39;s Fed is believed to be &#39;pulling off&#39; a soft landing for the economy by making it sunnier than it was a year ago. In California, they&#39;re dealing with water scarcity due to climate change; meanwhile hair-loss influencers on TikTok are trying to destigmatize insecurity.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
