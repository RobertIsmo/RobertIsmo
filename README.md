<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot happening in the United States and around the world. In the U.S., the Biden administration is expanding border wall construction along the southern border in response to the high number of migrants in the Rio Grande Valley. Meanwhile, the secretary of state and other top U.S. officials met with Mexico&#39;s president to discuss issues that have divided the two countries. Additionally, rising interest rates have sparked conversations about debt sustainability and diesel prices could cause inflation to remain high. Trump and other Republicans are also vocally opposing electric vehicle production which has already begun transitioning away from traditional fuel power. Elsewhere, Kevin McCarthy&#39;s sudden fall and exit from House Speaker is indicative of deepening political divisions in Washington D.C. In Alabama, court orders are requiring them to make changes to congressional districts that could result in the first two Black representatives being elected into Congress if carried out properly. Lastly, Cornel West has dropped his Green Party nomination for president and is now running as an independent instead. On a slightly lighter note, there is also news of Nobel Prize winner Jon Fosse receiving acclaim for his literature that explores mortality and religion.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
