<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Donald Trump has been accused of falsifying records, lying to the tax authorities, and engaging in a hush-money deal with a porn star to protect his 2016 campaign. His lawyers are pushing back on the charges and Trump is maintaining his innocence. In Wisconsin, Janet Protasiewicz won a Supreme Court race that will likely reverse the states&#39; abortion ban and end the use of gerrymandered legislative maps. In Chicago, voters elected Brandon Johnson as their next mayor, rejecting Paul Vallas who took a hard line on crime. On the foreign policy front, France is trying to get China involved in pressuring Russia to end the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, there are issues involving how higher salaries affect education access for lower-income students and how it affects internships at bigger tech companies. And finally Poland is clashing with the E.U. and fighting for allies for their crusade against Russia over Ukraine.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
