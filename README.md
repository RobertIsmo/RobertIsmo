<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Former President Donald Trump has been arraigned on documents and obstruction charges, and he&#39;s entered a not guilty plea in court. Democrats around the world are divided over whether this is good for the country or not. Allies of the United States are pressuring the Biden Administration to hasten NATO membership for Ukraine. In Russia, soldiers have been committing war crimes with impunity, while citizens of Japan are investing strongly in their stock markets, hoping for corporate overhauls that will last. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve expects to pause interest rates for now but could raise them again later this year. In New York City, people from Bangladesh are celebrating traditional values while Mayor Eric Adams&#39; administration has been hit by an exodus of its top officials. Finally, home insurance rates are skyrocketing everywhere due to the number of weather-induced disasters, so homeowners need to be smart about how they save money on coverage.</p>

<h3>Democrats Celebrate and Fear the Indictment of a ‘Chaos Machine’</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
