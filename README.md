<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s an eventful time in the world right now. There&#39;s a lot of tension in Israel and its surrounding countries, as the US is trying to negotiate a peace between Israel and Lebanon on their border. In Prague, the Czech Republic has been rocked by its worst mass shooting since World War II, and fourteen people were killed. There have been instances of violence against Israeli citizens, with one elderly man fatally shot when he and his wife were taken hostage recently. In the US, we&#39;re still dealing with impeachment inquiries against President Trump for corruption among other accusations, though most of the suggestions made by the GOP don&#39;t seem to hold up to scrutiny. Meanwhile, November saw a decrease in inflation and price increases cooling off compared to October, which is good news for consumers. There&#39;s also new technology emerging that&#39;s creating competition for big companies like Apple, which some claim could be dangerous for monopolies. Finally, there are grassroots movements in Ukraine aiming to prioritize military funds over social spending programs.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
