<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 9, Central Standard Time</p>

There has been a lot of news recently about the US college administrations and policies related to antisemitism. The president of University of Pennsylvania, Elizabeth Magill, resigned due to intense pressure from donors, politicians and alumni. Congress held a hearing to address college antisemitism which resulted in tense exchanges among university presidents, and the Biden Administration declared an emergency to expedite arms shipments to the Middle East. 

Meanwhile, Hamas has grown in power and prestige, despite worries of civilian death tolls due to Israeli airstrikes. There is also a lot going on with artificial intelligence research and development. 

In other news, the Republican presidential candidates had a much calmer debate during an &quot;In God We Trust&quot; event and there was some controversy over who was allowed to take part in Iowa&#39;s first-in-the-nation caucuses. Former President Donald Trump&#39;s tendency towards autocracy has been widely debated as well. Minnesota is also making great progress towards creating a new state flag. And just for fun, if you want trying your hand at tactical strategy there’s an exciting online version of Wheel of Fortune you can play!  Lastly, electric vehicles from two-wheeled machines up to cars are showing promise as countries like Poland prioritize energy transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
