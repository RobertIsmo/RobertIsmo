<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s a pretty rough picture out there right now. We&#39;ve had dozens of mass shootings across the US in the first few weeks of 2023, killing over sixty people. The Pentagon is increasing artillery production for Ukraine, and there&#39;s some controversy around classified documents found at former Vice President Pence&#39;s home in Indiana. On the tech front, Google is facing an antitrust lawsuit from the US Department of Justice. Taylor Swift fans are watching the Ticketmaster hearing, and this year&#39;s Oscars nominations have caused quite a stir with several surprises and snubs. The Republican Party is facing internal polarization in Pennsylvania. College athletes are making big money through sponsorships, but with uncertain consequences for others. In other places, people have put their savings into homes that were never built, and New Yorkers are lining up for entertainment and food again. Finally, Native Americans may finally get recognition for safeguarding a sacred site near Las Vegas.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
