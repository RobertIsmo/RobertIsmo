<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, it looks like former president Trump paid $1.1 million in taxes while in office but nothing in 2020, according to a report. The current president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, is scheduled to meet with President Biden and address Congress in Washington. Lawmakers are fast-tracking a $1.7 trillion spending bill that will help Americans save for retirement and provides billions of dollars in emergency aid. However, this bill is currently facing a snag due to a dispute between Virginia and Maryland lawmakers over the relocation of an F.B.I. building. Meanwhile, on the international front, the Taliban in Afghanistan has barred women from attending college classes in a stark reversal of their rights, but they&#39;ve released two American hostages previously held in their custody. On the business side of things, Google is pushing for clean energy efforts across the U.S., but this is facing opposition from utilities, especially in the Southeast where there is a lack of competition. Lastly, here in New York City Mayor Eric Adams has urged everyone to resume wearing masks due to rising numbers of viral illnesses such as Covid-19, flu and RSV.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
