<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news coming out of the world lately. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro has taken refuge in Florida while the current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was inaugurated. Russia is making a big move in India and their invasion of Ukraine is having a huge effect on the global system. Ukraine has been facing relentless air strikes from Russian forces, with no end in sight. In response to the tech cold war with China, U.S companies have been investing nearly $200 billion into chip manufacturing since early 2021. Philosophical and theological debates about when life begins are at the center of the nation&#39;s abortion debate, as well as Congress members departing leaving little prospect of orderly business due to the gridlock among others. The average U.S household waste nearly a third of food bought, so Central Ohio is starting to nudge its residents to change their habits. A suspect accused of murdering four University of Idaho students had been studying criminal minds which raises more questions than answers concerning his motivations. Anita Pointer, who was a lead singer in the Pointer sister group, sadly passed away recently and in Massachusetts they are struggling with electric-green algae blooms due to climate change that could cost billions to fix. Finally, New York state just had their first female governor Kathy Hochul sworn in for a full term and she appealed for unity during her inauguration speech.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
