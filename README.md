<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of tension between the U.S and China, with the U.S pushing for more restrictions to combat a global fentanyl crisis. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates, potentially based on the strength of the labor market. Businesses are preparing for a looming UPS strike and having to rethink their supply chains. The New York Public Library is making changes in hopes of drawing in more visitors, which could also be true for Penn Station in New York. The Biden administration is also pushing for a drug called Leqembi to become widely accessible, since it may treat Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Lastly, wolves have been spotted back in the Northeast after a hunter shot one in upstate New York, symbolizing change for wildlife conservation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
