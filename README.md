<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Hawaii, there was a horrible wildfire which has sadly led to 106 deaths so far, and families are still trying to find their missing loved ones. There are also insurance companies that have come to light which are selling insurance to insurers to help people with natural disasters. Moving on to politics, Donald Trump and 18 of his allies face a racketeering case in Georgia, which has caused tension among Republicans over how the 2020 election was handled. Also in Georgia, some abortion pill restrictions have been upheld recently by the appeals court. New York City is in the midst of a migrant crisis and has responded to demands from New York State for help but some Democrats have written a scathing letter saying NYC has already refused some offers and is slow to help. In the Black Sea area, Russian ships are making threats but Romania has provided a lifeline channel that allows Ukrainian grain to reach the sea as it is protected by NATO. Lastly, there is someone who works for Santos who involved himself in impersonating Speaker Kevin McCarthy&#39;s chief of staff during fund-raising appeals; he now faces federal charges. As for health issues, scientists have started understanding the effects of &#39;forever chemicals&#39; found almost everywhere and beginning understand how it impacts our health. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
