<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like it&#39;s been a pretty eventful few days around the world. In Ukraine, citizens in one city have been fighting back against Russian forces and their plan, with spy and partisan cells coming together to thwart it. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin is still claiming he invaded Ukraine to protect Russian interests and Christmas lights are being used as a symbol of standing strong despite the war. 

Over in the US, parts of Buffalo are reeling from a winter storm that killed at least three people and left thousands without power while police departments are offering bonuses to lure recruits. In Britain, there&#39;s a railway bridge that gets bashed into by vehicles with alarming regularity. 

In terms of fun stuff, there&#39;s a new Greek Orthodox house of worship in town (21 years after its destruction on 9&#x2F;11), an OK basketball player hoping to be a great NBA team owner, the Netflix series &#39;Emily is Still in Paris&#39;, and for those brave enough for some travel - Iceland&#39;s Ring Road offers drivers midnight sun (in Summer) plus snowy delights (in Winter).</p>

<h3>How Citizen Spies Foiled Putin’s Grand Plan for One Ukrainian City</h3>
<sub>By Jeffrey Gettleman</sub>
<p>A partisan cell in Kherson spied on, undermined and even hunted down Russian soldiers. Now that Vladimir V. Putin’s forces are gone, people feel free to talk — and to brag a little.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3I2fS1M"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Putin Insists He Is Ready for Peace Talks, as Air-Raid Sirens Sound Across Ukraine</h3>
<sub>By Andrew E. Kramer and Anton Troianovski</sub>
<p>The alert was lifted in most areas after about two hours. President Vladimir V. Putin repeated the claim that he invaded Ukraine to defend Russia’s national interests.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3FM00gQ"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>In Ukraine, Christmas Lights Defy Darkness of War, and Children Ask for Peace</h3>

<p>One town is protecting a statue of St. Nick with sandbags, another is putting its Christmas tree underground and others are cranking up noisy generators to keep the holiday spirit alive.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3YMMPFe"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Winter Storm Leaves Buffalo and Its Region Reeling</h3>

<p>At least three people have died in Erie County, and thousands were without power. The bitingly cold temperatures are expected to persist.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3GihiUg"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>As Applications Fall, Police Departments Lure Recruits With Bonuses and Attention</h3>

<p>Many police chiefs say staffing levels have not rebounded from a wave of resignations that started with the pandemic and the 2020 unrest.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3YMk7V1"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Another Day, Another Crash: Life by Britain’s Most Bashed Bridge</h3>
<sub>By Stephen Castle</sub>
<p>A railway bridge with a shallow underpass is bashed into by vehicles with startling regularity, causing mostly embarrassment, but sending cargo — flowers, bicycles, eggs and potatoes — flying onto the roadway.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3PQ8FDC"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Emily Is Still in Paris. Why Are We Still Watching?</h3>

<p>The Netflix hit has been widely mocked from the beginning. But despite its flaws — or perhaps because of them — it’s a pop-culture phenomenon.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3hMwTlP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Black Ice and White Knuckles: Braving the Elements on Iceland’s Ring Road</h3>
<sub>By Eric A. Taub</sub>
<p>In summer, the roughly 830-mile route offers drivers midnight sun, along with plenty of traffic. Other times of the year, its snowy delights are more solitary, and slippery.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3vdgQ3z"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
