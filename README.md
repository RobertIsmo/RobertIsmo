<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world seem pretty chaotic right now. Climate change is really hitting hard in Arizona – apparently their water supply is so low they had to stop construction. In politics, the GOP wants more military funding, while Biden took a stumble at an Air Force commencement. We&#39;re also learning more about how coronavirus affects our lungs – and that&#39;s serious. On a lighter note, some professor in Georgetown got into trouble for installing giant Transformers sculptures, and people are trying to figure out how many LGBTQ Americans die by suicide every year. It&#39;s kind of a lot happening all at once!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
