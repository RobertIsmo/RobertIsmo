<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I&#39;ve got stories from all over the world! In Israel, some people are feeling like death is unavoidable due to airstrikes that tend to come without warning. In Michigan, many Muslim and Arab American voters are reconsidering their support of President Biden&#39;s support for Israel. A gunman in Maine had paranoid beliefs before taking part in a mass shooting. Right now, Africa has the fastest-growing population which is leading to social changes worldwide. In Congress, the new House Speaker has put his faith at the forefront of his political career. Also, he says his views on race were shaped by raising a black child. To top it off, Hurricane Otis has caused destruction in Acapulco, causing death tolls to rise and desperation for aid to increase. And finally, a series of stories coming from India show how two women are putting their lives on the line while chasing opportunity.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
