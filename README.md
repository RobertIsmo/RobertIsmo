<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the Biden Administration has taken action to reduce fossil fuel activities on millions of acres of public land and in federal waters, which has triggered some controversy. In other news, some health concerns have been raised about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that may be affecting his legislative voting stances. Additionally, a convict escaped from a Pennsylvania prison recently due to an officer error.

In sports news, the young tennis star Coco Gauff has made it to her first US Open singles final at only 19 years old. However, environmental protesters stopped her semifinal match for almost an hour when one person glued their feet to the ground. The same protesters also showed up to stop other events in an effort to call attention to climate change and global warming.

There are political controversies, too. Peter Navarro was recently convicted of contempt of Congress for disregarding their investigations of the Trump administration. And recently Representative Jim Jordan was accused of trying to obstruct Fani T. Willis&#39;s investigation into the racketeering case against former President Trump and his allies.

In New York City Mayor Eric Adams is warning citizens that the migrant crisis could &#39;destroy&#39; the city unless there is federal help given. Lastly, more information about Covid-19&#39;s effect on the heart has been made clear recently as well as advice not to get your next booster shot until a new formulation is available. Finally, First Lady Jill Biden recently tested negative for Covid-19 after a brief episode that threatened President Biden&#39;s trip out of the country for the Group of 20 summit in India.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
