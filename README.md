<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. Businesses have been impacted significantly by winter storms in recent weeks. For example, Southwest Airlines has canceled over 60% of their flights due to severe weather. Meanwhile, families are mourning those killed in the storm across New York. In the Western U.S., an “atmospheric river” storm system could bring flooding and mudslides. Elsewhere, travelers who had their bags misplaced because of flight delays and cancellations may not know what to do. At the same time, migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border are facing expulsion policies as a result of the pandemic. Even more recently, transcripts revealed that former President Trump considered blanketing pardons during the January 6 attack on the Capitol. On top of all this, the new Webb Telescope is revealing astonishing new knowledge about our universe, and Ukraine and Russia are locked in a battle for a gateway city in Eastern Ukraine – Kreminna. Oh, and this is all without even mentioning the controversy around U.S. Congressman-elect George Santos regarding his heritage and Native American ancestry claims. So yeah… it&#39;s been a wild week!</p>

<h3>Migrant Expulsion Policy Must Stay in Place for Now, Supreme Court Says</h3>
<sub>By Adam Liptak, Miriam Jordan and Eileen Sullivan</sub>
<p>The temporary stay in lifting the pandemic rule known as Title 42 is a provisional victory for 19 states, led mostly by Republicans, that had sought to keep it in place on the border.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3GlZkQO"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Jan. 6 Transcripts Shed New Light on How Trump Considered Blanket Pardons</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
