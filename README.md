<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of events happening around the world right now. In the US, Joe Biden is running for president again and people are frustrated because they feel like their promises have not been kept. South Carolina Democrats just elected their first Black woman to run their state party. In Ukraine, there is a potential for a spring offensive and someone who lost his legs in the war is trying to run a marathon. Crimea had a large fire in an fuel depot after apparently being attacked by a drone but Ukraine did not claim responsibility. First Republic is going bankrupt and will soon be seized by the FDIC. Donald Trump is also facing further legal jeopardy while still managing to continue his campaign against it. And finally, there is a huge jewelry sale involving Nazi-looted gems, and Denver airport has become the center of many weird conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
