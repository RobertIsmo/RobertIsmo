<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is in a bit of an upheaval. We&#39;re seeing a lot of tensions in areas like the Middle East, where US and Israeli forces are clashing with Hamas and there&#39;s growing anxiety among mothers as their children go to fight in Gaza. The climate is also changing rapidly due to global warming and artificial intelligence is emerging as one potential way of mitigating that - although the amount of energy it requires could make things worse. Businesses are struggling with worker discontent and doctors and pharmacists are even starting to revolt against demands on their time. Technology is also advancing at a rapid rate, with venture capitalists, tech execs, and researchers making advances in the field of artificial intelligence that could change our world significantly in the coming years.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
