<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is preparing to roll out two new Covid vaccinations developed by Pfizer and Moderna, while conspiracy theorists are stoking fear about the increasing infection levels. In Morocco, aid is being provided to those affected by a recent earthquake, but there are residents desperate for basic supplies who feel they&#39;ve been abandoned. North Korea has something Russia needs, and new wrinkle in their relationship as Kim Jong-un may get advanced technology and food aid in return. A fugitive from Brazil escaped from prison near Philadelphia in 2017 and is still at large. In New York City, the cost of child care has become incredibly expensive for even upper-middle-class residents while providers of the care face financial strain too. In Hawaii, China has been propagating misinformation using advanced artificial intelligence tactics. Republicans are trying to take control of Virginia&#39;s state government with the ambition of Glenn Youngkin who wants to be governor on a national level. Finally, the 22nd anniversary of 9&#x2F;11 was marked by a somber ceremony in Manhattan that was attended by relatives of those who died, governors, senators and the vice president.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
