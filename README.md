<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In the U.S., Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been given an exclusive invite to join the Horatio Alger Association, and that brings up questions about how this can give him an advantage. Elsewhere, China and the U.S. are talking for the first time in a while despite their deep differences; we&#39;re also hearing from an ex-insider on business in China who is saying that the economy is much worse off than outsiders realize. 

Meanwhile, appealing to Christian voters has become a focus of one politician in the US, while Nikki Haley is making a pitch in New Hampshire but its unclear if it will have any effect moving into 2024. NATO is looking to strengthen its own defenses along its eastern flank at an upcoming summit and there still exists talk of imperial power being unfairly placed on America&#39;s most forgotten citizens in certain Pacific territories. 

On a lighter note, experts are offering some tips on how to sleeps better no matter what age you are, although North Korean refugees trying to escape via China have been running into some roadblocks due to digital surveillance and profiteering. And in Florida, toxic slime blooms have been threatening wildlife and people alike, while females in real estate have been facing their own dangers from potential clients with virtually no protections in place. Finally, the Weekender offers an update on the &#39;tale of Hunter Biden&#39;s child&#39; as well as Tom Brady&#39;s crypto ambitions colliding with reality - so that might be something worth checking out too!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
