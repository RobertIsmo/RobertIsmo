<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, some serious and concerning news is happening across the world. In New York, a U.S. Attorney accused an Indian official of directing an assassination plot in Manhattan. In the Middle East, there is fear that a miscommunication between U.S. and Iranian forces could lead to a larger war. There were 10 Israelis and four Thai nationals that were recently released as hostages from an ongoing conflict, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned against any form of antisemitism. On a lighter note, Tesla CEO Elon Musk got feisty with advertisers who tried to pull back from one of his companies. Pope Francis has been cracking down on any critics that attempt to derail his agenda for the Catholic Church. Maria Callas would have turned 100 recently and her life continues to be a beacon of artistic integrity and profundity in opera. Health-wise, U.S. life expectancy is continuing to creep up but there are still those deaths related to Covid-19 that make it difficult for the country’s health to fully recover. In the Supreme Court this week, there is concern over whether certain enforcement actions can be taken before its own judges instead of in federal courts. And finally, looking back at one of the top TV series this past year there was ‘The Bear,’ ‘Beef,’ ‘Happy Valley,’ ‘Reservation Dogs’ and ‘Succession’ that dazzled us while the business was in disarray due to Covid-19. Rosalynn Carter made a final trip back to her home church for her last goodbye with those who had known her best.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
