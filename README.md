<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is in a turbulent state. In Russia, Vladimir Putin is leading people into an ongoing civilizational conflict with the West that&#39;s more intense than Ukraine. Meanwhile, in Ukraine itself, war is grinding on and intensifying with both sides striking and firing at each other. 

In the US, Republicans and Iowa voters are focussing less on &#39;wokeness&#39; and more on law and order. The Kennedy family is facing some discord as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. runs for presidency against their wishes, and technology issues are rising with Porcha Woodruff being wrongfully accused of carjacking through facial recognition technology.

Sports fans have heard about Megan Rapinoe recently, who had to deal with an unfortunate ending to her World Cup career. Serial killers are becoming rarer because of improved technology and a more cautious society but other forms of mayhem are increasing. In Maine, a woman has bought an entire remote island for an intriguing reason and ESPN is creating problems for Disney in other areas.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
