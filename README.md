<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To start, there is tension between Russia and Ukraine on their border, with NATO preparing for potential combat. Additionally, in Sudan, rival factions of the military have been fighting and it is unclear who is in control. On the sports front, Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri has moved to Colorado to try and win a marathon while Eliud Kipchoge is set to tackle the tricky Boston Marathon. In terms of business news, Fox News has gone up against the voting machine company Dominion in a $1.6 billion defamation case. Meanwhile in the US, Republican Jim Jordan has risen to power and is facing criticism from both sides amidst an alleged sex abuse scandal. Additionally, there are new electric car tax breaks which favor US-made vehicles and Joe Biden is being pushed to launch his 2024 campaign sooner. Finally, people are noticing office crushes as everything remains largely unknown.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
