<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, pandas may still come to the United States from China, and a man has been arrested in California in connection to the death of a Jewish protester. In addition, there have been some federal criminal cases involving conspiracy theorists. On another note, a congressman from New York is not seeking re-election due to evidence of possible crimes, and he was found to have been spending donor money for personal items like Ferragamo shoes. On the government front, there is political tension as House Republicans are trying to punish the Biden administration through spending bills while Congress works to avoid another government shutdown. Also, an altercation in San Francisco has been raising questions about what actually occurred. Furthermore, there is an election going on in Iowa between Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, and voters have been discussing Kamala Harris (but not Joe Biden). Lastly, a major surge in cryptocurrency prices is being driven by speculation about a Bitcoin exchange traded fund.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
