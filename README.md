<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of contentious issues arising in the world right now. In the United States, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has recently arrived in Washington at a critical moment, while Harvard&#39;s board is facing criticism about their president&#39;s responses to questions on antisemitism at a congressional hearing. Israel and Gaza have been embroiled in a 9-week long war causing destruction to many communities, with Gazans struggling to make sense of Israeli evacuation orders that are sometimes hard to understand. On the home front, millions of people in Texas witnessed an unprecedented ruling by the Supreme Court denying a woman access to an abortion, while a 123-year-old Jewish organization grapples with the consequences of taking either side of the conflict. Despite all the turmoil, appetite for American dishes continues, with 23 dishes from around the US gracing our best American dishes list this year.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
