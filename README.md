<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, Russia and a mercenary group led by &quot;Prigozhin&quot; have been in an ongoing standoff. The United States has suspicions that Prigozhin is preparing to take military action against Russia. Meanwhile, this year marks a year since the Supreme Court&#39;s decision eliminating the national right to abortion, leading to many activists rallying around this issue. Internationally, there&#39;s been developments in Canada as investigators board a ship that launched an ill-fated submersible, and a current Hollywood producer in Israel is set to testify at an important trial for the country&#39;s prime minister. Closer to home, TikTok has provided more music exposure for Meghan Trainor, while health care is looking very bright for new innovations. Finally, endangering turtles in Myanmar have made good progress with a recent hatching of eggs captured on video by local conservationists.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
