<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, there have been reports of people being forced to enlist in the military, and there’s a delay in receiving aid from European Union allies. Meanwhile, gun sales have spiked in Israel amid tension with Hamas. On the Egyptian border, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are blocked from entering due to heavily fortified security. In the US, debates over free speech have heated up since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Democratic candidates who criticize Israel are facing close challengers supported by AIPAC campaign funding. In addition, news of Retirements in the House could lead to a serious shakeup in the 2024 election. Lastly, Prince Harry scored a legal victory against a U.K tabloid hacking his phone, while New Mexico&#39;s spaceport plans remain unfulfilled and the US military is training for future threats in Hawaii.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
