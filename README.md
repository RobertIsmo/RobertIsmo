<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there has been a lot going on around the world. At the Republican presidential debate, the candidates mostly left their party’s front-runner Donald Trump unscathed, though he got only ten minutes of questions from the moderators. In Moscow, the American reporter Evan Gershkovich has been wrongfully detained and his pretrial detention was extended by a court. Meanwhile, Mr. Giuliani, Donald Trump&#39;s personal lawyer in the aftermath of the 2020 election, surrendered at a jail in Georgia election case. Biden incentives for foreign investment are benefiting factories but have not yet increased investment. The company NVIDIA is seeing huge success with its artificial intelligence chips and is nearly tripling revenue from last year. A paralyzed woman is regaining her speech ability through AI and India has had a successful space mission with its Chandrayaan-3 mission making it the first country to reach the lunar south polar region in one piece. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa have invited six countries to join their club of emerging nations and two men convicted for a grisly 1993 murder were granted new trials after an explosive claim came out linking it to Richard Matt (one of two escapees from one of New York’s most famous jailbreaks). Finally, opinion pieces have been circulating discussing Republican moral cowardice and an individual’s ultimate betrayal in Putin’s Russia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
