<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension and conflict over certain issues in the world. China is challenging the Biden administration&#39;s push for the Chinese ownership of TikTok to sell, or potentially be banned in the US. In Israel, there was a mass protest of a proposed judicial reform law and in Memphis police are using car seizures to punish people for certain crimes. In Turkey, earthquakes caused major damage to businesses and homes, and the former president Donald Trump is facing possible prosecution for a hush-money payment in the US. There is also a strange story of an aspiring cult leader&#39;s nephew trying to make his painting public again. Meanwhile, a married couple decided to swap their family home in Pennsylvania for one in California. These events are all tests of our values, beliefs and courage.</p>

<h3>With Beijing opposing a TikTok sale, the Biden administration’s options narrow.</h3>

<p>If the White House can’t force a sale, that would effectively leave it with two options to resolve concerns about the company.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3FK3Bgi"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Meet the Lonely New York Progressive Defending TikTok</h3>

<h3>Prosecutor in Trump Hush-Money Case Fires Back at House Republicans</h3>

<h3>See One Historic Turkish Street Before and After the Earthquakes</h3>

<p>The Times flew a drone over a street in Antakya’s Old City to show the places that were lost — among them, a barber shop, a historic church and doner kebab shops.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3yZfbAp"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>In Memphis, Car Seizures Are a Lucrative and Punishing Police Tactic</h3>

<p>Vehicle seizures have been used to combat street racing and other crimes, but critics say that even people not convicted of a crime have been left for months without their cars.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Z839PR"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
