<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some worrying news reports from around the world. In the Middle East, Israeli forces have carried out a 3-Day raid in a Palestinian city, killing at least 12 people and leaving the city. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, European Union leaders are opening talks for membership into the EU, while Russia ramps up its clashes with Ukraine and Finland has closed its border with Russia due to an influx of migrants. In Germany, a spy is on trial for selling state secrets to Russia and here in the US there is talk about free speech at universities and the passing of a defense bill by Congress. The Fed seems to be doing better than expected with economic outlook looking more promising. However, California is dealing with water disputes due to climate change. Finally, a classic holiday special - Charlie Brown Christmas - brings many meanings to Jews living in North America.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
