<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like the world is constantly in a state of flux. Right now, we&#39;re seeing shifts in the global economy that nobody predicted, and tensions remain high between China and Ukraine. In Russia, there are investigations underway about whether or not a dam was blown up from the inside. In America, people have been shocked by how young our latest governor is and how out of step some of his views are with younger voters. Our former president has been facing legal issues as a result of documents relating to him. Meanwhile dads everywhere are wearing the same styles, and people around the world are growing aware of human slavery still at work today. There&#39;s also this cryptocurrency legal issue that&#39;s perplexing those involved. Remote workers are changing where people live, even if they mostly seem to be going to Austin for some reason. An American whistleblower is trying to bring attention to an important constitutional issue by seeking new charges against him at 90 years old. Lionel Messi is also making news due to his multimillion-dollar relationship with Saudi Arabia. Samantha Irby is many people&#39;s role model in terms of body-image acceptance, while Los Angeles rich are going to great lengths to block prying eyes out from their homes.</p>

<sub>By James Glanz, Marc Santora, Pablo Robles, Haley Willis, Lauren Leatherby, Christoph Koettl and Dmitriy Khavin</sub>
<p>The Kakhovka dam was designed to withstand almost any attack imaginable — from the outside. An inside job was another matter.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Nc5R2W"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Addicts Went in for Treatment. Instead They Were Enslaved.</h3>

<h3>Why the Pentagon Papers Leaker Tried to Get Prosecuted Near His Life’s End</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
