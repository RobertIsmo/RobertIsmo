<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. On the political front, House Republicans have passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling while cutting spending by nearly 14% over a decade, but President Biden has vowed to veto it. Trump&#39;s accuser has given detailed testimony in court. Meanwhile, Republicans are increasingly pushing back against corporations they deem &quot;woke&quot;, with Florida governor Ron DeSantis taking on Disney in a lawsuit over his control of its resort in the state. In Ukraine, Soledar, which was crushed in Russia&#39;s assault on Bakhmut, is treasured as a symbol of loss in many Ukrainian kitchens as its salt is a national staple. Finally, Twitter recently changed its authentication features, making it harder to tell which news sources are reliable.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
