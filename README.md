<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Israel which is causing mass destruction and displacement to millions of people. To the east, China and the United States are engaged in a disagreement over surveillance operations which is raising justified concerns about their ability to remain peaceful during this time. In other news, Kamala Harris is still trying to define her vice presidency, Beyoncé made history at the Grammy awards with a record for the most career Grammys won by any artist and Tesla CEO Elon Musk is trying to cleanse Twitter from child abuse content with unfortunately limited success.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
