<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, both parties are debating whether to include military assistance for the fight against Russia in any plans to keep the government funded past the end of the month, which could result in a government shutdown if no agreement is reached. The far right is also contributing to mass dysfunction and trying to spark an impeachment and House coup. Meanwhile, Ukraine has killed the chief of Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet in response to its involvement in Crimea and Canada&#39;s House Speaker apologized after honoring a Ukrainian who fought with Nazis. On the political front in the US, 7 candidates have qualified for a Republican debate andTim Scott is running for president, though he is unmarried. President Trump meanwhile visited a gun store and raised legal questions when he asked to buy a Glock. Internationally, author Caitlin Moran just penned a book about modern masculinity and how to fix it. Finally, excessive water usage in US fracking operations and aquifers draining due to overuse are both causing serious environmental concerns across America.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
