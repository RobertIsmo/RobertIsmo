<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, June 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In Ukraine, they are bracing for possible disease outbreaks as floodwaters recede and trying to take back Russian territory in a counteroffensive. Russia has shifted their battlefield tactics, improving discipline and coordination. In Canada, they are facing the worst wildfire season on record, and foreign firefighters have arrived to help combat the fires. In Beijing, US Secretary of State Blinken will be chatting with Chinese officials to smooth over their tensions. In Minneapolis, there is a scathing report released by the Justice Department detailing police activity, which has left residents searching for next steps. And in Nevada, Governor DeSantis is rallying Republicans to end their &quot;culture of losing&quot;. Health care has also changed dramatically, with the corporatization of medicine leaving many physicians feeling alienated from their work.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
