<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there is quite a bit happening in the world right now! In the US, House Speaker McCarthy is attempting to strike a balance between passing a debt deal and keeping his job. Also, there&#39;s a plan to clean up 54 million gallons of radioactive bomb-making waste, but it may never be achieved. In California, climate shocks are making parts of the state uninsurable. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, NATO and Russia are trying to solve the issues brought on by climate change. Fake Signals and American insurance is giving Russian oil trouble, with tankers faking their locations while transporting oil that is currently under Western sanctions. In fashion, the High School of Fashion Industries just had its biggest and sassiest spring fashion show ever. In business, Europe is fretting about battery factory subsidies as the US races ahead in production. In music, Freddie Mercury reportedly changed &quot;Mongolian Rhapsody&quot; to its current title &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Former US President Trump is asking for a judge in his hush-money case to step aside. Turkish LGBTQ people are feeling threatened after Erdogan vilified them during his reelection campaign. Lastly, James Beard Foundation is investigating chefs to weed out any nominees with problematic pasts after creating a new process to do so.</p>

<h3>Can McCarthy Pass the Debt Deal and Keep His Job?</h3>
<sub>By Catie Edmondson</sub>
<p>The House speaker attempted to strike a careful balance: he could lose conservatives’ votes but could not afford to reach a deal that so infuriated the far right that they would move to oust him.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43x2Lgq"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Climate Shocks Are Making Parts of America Uninsurable. It Just Got Worse.</h3>
<sub>By Christopher Flavelle, Jill Cowan and Ivan Penn</sub>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
