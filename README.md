<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. There&#39;s an air traffic controller shortage and reports of exhausted controllers that could be making dangerous mistakes. Israeli generals are being scrutinized after intelligence errors were exposed. There are also repercussions from a major Hamas attack in October, with people angry at Benjamin Netanyahu. In the US, a former congressman was forced out after it was revealed he was breaking campaign finance laws, and there&#39;s a high-stakes election for his seat in New York. Beyoncé also put out an almost three-hour long concert movie. On top of that, Supreme Court Justice Sandra O&#39;Connor sadly passed away, leaving a legacy inspiring women across different fields. Lastly, hurricane season saw an unusually large amount of costly storms that&#39;ve been rapidly intensifying. Finally, desperate families have been struggling to find affordable home care for aging family members.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
