<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot of news lately about US politics, including the indictment of former president Donald Trump in New York, and leaked documents that reveal the country&#39;s spy efforts and Russia&#39;s military struggles. Technology and social media sites like Twitter and Discord have also been making headlines - they&#39;re trying to better handle the circulation of online material, and are facing gray areas in their regulations.

In the climate field, the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing new regulations to ensure that electric cars make up the majority of US auto sales by 2032, while scientists have also been analyzing electric vehicles to trigger an electric car revolution. There has been recognition of young political activism stirring up shockwaves across the US, as well as discussion on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis&#39; preparedness for his 2024 campaign.

Finally, there&#39;s some interesting stories about arts and entertainment: A YouTube talk show (Hot Ones) has gained traction lately with its simple set-up - deep cut questions with extra spicy wings - and in sports news, golf superstar Tiger Woods was at the bottom of the leaderboard when flooded Augusta National suspended play at the weekend.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
