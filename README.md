<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of tension in the world right now. In Israel and Gaza, a surprise attack by militants has put the two sides on a war footing. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing pressure to launch a full-scale invasion, something Israel has been avoiding since 2005. At the US border with Mexico, there&#39;s a growing migrant crisis as resources strain under the influx of thousands of people. To try and stop it, Governor Greg Abbott has deployed more troops and installed razor wire. In Ohio, an unapologetic right-wing politician is becoming a prominent figure in the Republican Party. And in California, speed cameras may soon be installed to combat rising pedestrian deaths across the country. On top of all that, people are feeling the financial burden of owning a car due to pandemic disruption – but they can still save money by purchasing electric vehicles used.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
