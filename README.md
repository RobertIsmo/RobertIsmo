<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of tragic events in the world lately. In Greece, the Coast Guard is facing criticism for how they handled a migrant mass drowning. In Pakistan, they recently declared a day of mourning for a migrant ship disaster off Greece that killed more than 100 Pakistanis. In China, their rebound has hit a wall and there&#39;s no quick fix to revive it. There&#39;s also been some international news, such as Russia attempting to kill a CIA defector in Florida, as well as British Explorer and businessman Hamish Harding going missing aboard a submersible. On a lighter note, Florida governor Ron DeSantis made an interesting fundraising stop in California recently and poked fun at Governor Gavin Newsom. Lastly, in Ukraine’s city of Lviv, funerals have become grim routines as gravediggers brace for even more bodies due to escalation of counteroffensive fighting.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
