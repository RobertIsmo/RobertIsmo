<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, North Korea is looking to leverage theUkraine War by seeking missile and warhead technology from Russia. In the US, a huge threat to the budget has receded but no one is sure why. There&#39;s been a decline in faith in the value of college, with questions of who&#39;s to blame. On the health front, the US Senate minority leader has released new assurances from the Capitol’s physician after an examination found no signs of stroke or seizure. In Colorado, a city has been fighting for decades to use its own water due to lawsuits. Archaeologists have found the 400-year-old corpse of suspected child revenant in Europe. In Pennsylvania, schools are closed as authorities search for an escaped prisoner sentenced to life for homicide. Sports fans are excited that 19-year-old Coco Gauff is now one match away from her first career singles final at the US Open. In New York, plans were announced for the NYPD to drop a contentious tactic used during protests as part of an agreement with state attorney general and other activist groups. Three governor&#39;s races across the US show ads focused on issues like education, economy, jobs and taxes as well as local scandals and crime. At the Venice Film Festival there was a mixed reception for Woody Allen&#39;s 50th film Coup de Chance both from critics and protesters who asked organizers to &quot;turn the spotlight off of rapists.&quot; And finally, tennis fans gave rise to online trends after professional player Frances Tiafoe requested multiple changes in shirts midmatch.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
