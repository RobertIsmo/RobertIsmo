<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. For example, China has publicly opposed the Biden administration&#39;s push to force the sale of the app TikTok in the US. In an Appeals Court ruling in the US, a Trump lawyer was recently ordered to hand over certain records related to an inquiry. In Turkey, there was a recent spate of earthquakes that destroyed some historical sites like barber shops and churches. In Memphis, police tactics have been used to seize cars for street racing and other crimes. In Ukraine, tank commanders are preparing for battles with Russia with Soviet-era tanks. Meanwhile in Jackson Mississippi, one leaking pipe is releasing 5 million gallons of water per day. In terms of economics, markets are trying to figure out what comes next after the banking crisis and Bank of England has recently raised rates due to inflation persisting. In Africa, the US is competing with Russia in areas like Chad and running Pentagon’s annual Flintlock Exercise as terrorists move south through Sahel. Finally, back home in Los Angeles, school workers are striking leading to many parents joining their cause since they understand each other&#39;s economic plight in one of the nation’s most expensive cities.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
