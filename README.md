<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the U.S., the Biden administration is advising Israel to delay its invasion of Gaza in order to allow time for negotiations and aid to the Palestinians while Hamas claims that Israel was behind an explosion that killed hundreds of people at a hospital in Gaza City—a claim which Israel denies. In addition, an Israeli reservist from Maryland was recently killed near the Lebanon border. Back home, there are questions concerning a billionaire&#39;s access to Trump with national security implications. Several Republicans are running for Speaker of the House and multiple other stories around the world can be mentioned too—such as commando raids startling Russia in Crimea, a missile strike killing 6 workers at a postal depot in Ukraine, and a few events related to climate change and movie releases.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
