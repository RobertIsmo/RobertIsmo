<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening around the world right now! In Iran, women are protesting the mandatory hijab law and wearing their hair in all kinds of styles to show defiance. In the United States, migrant children are being exploited by being employed in dangerous jobs that violate child labor laws. China is also raising concerns after they announced a state visit from the leader of Belarus when the US accused them of sending lethal aid to Russia. Additionally, Los Angeles is seeing flooding and Michigan is experiencing widespread blackouts after an ice storm. Climate change is affecting the Salton Sea and farms throughout California are facing water cuts due to drought and a dry Colorado River. Finally, Democrats in New York have been struggling with party unity ever since they lost seats in the midterms.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
