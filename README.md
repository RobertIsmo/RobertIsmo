<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of unrest in the world lately. Hostages in Gaza have been released after facing violence, hunger, and fear, and that has sparked heated debates around the world over how to respond. Meanwhile, on the political front, people are divided on how to handle the Israel-Hamas War. On top of that, we recently lost a major political figure as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger passed away at the age of 100. His decisions while in office still have effects on global politics today, particularly in Vietnam and Cambodia. There&#39;s also international drama with the alleged plot to assassinate a Sikh activist on U.S. soil and a failed bid by Jeff Zucker (backed by funds from the United Arab Emirates) to buy The Telegraph. Closer to home, divisions between party lines are still causing tensions in towns like Silverton, Colorado. And if you&#39;re looking for some positive news amidst it all, this year&#39;s music scene has some standout albums!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
