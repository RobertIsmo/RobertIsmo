<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In the US, Supreme Court decisions have given Democrats an opening to reach out to voters. And we&#39;ve been seeing many conversations about issues related to affirmative action and student loans in education. Meanwhile, tragedy has struck across the globe as there appears to have been preventable deaths in a recent migrant boat incident. Russia is facing attention by China and Ukraine to its connection with troop deployment. And French suburbs are reeling from police brutality and violence in response to it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
