<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The United States is dealing with the fallout from the Trump administration and its involvement with the Israeli spyware firm NSO. There&#39;s an impending criminal trial of Donald Trump, which has New York City on edge. Meanwhile, two senators who voted to impeach Trump have expressed concerns that his indictment might be political rather than criminal. 
In Finland, they&#39;re celebrating six consecutive years as the world&#39;s happiest country, though many Finns suggest reality isn&#39;t quite as wonderful as it looks from the outside. The country is also in the midst of a tight election that could lead to a change in leadership. 
In sports news, Louisiana State just won the Women&#39;s NCAA championship, with Angel Reese leading the way and setting an example for trash-talking off the court. Kim Mulkey was also just awarded her fourth title with LBSU, but her controversial relationship with Brittney Griner has been making headlines. Finally, one of Russia&#39;s most influential pro-war bloggers was killed in a St. Petersburg bombing. 
Finally, back in the US there&#39;s ongoing concern over Tulare Lake, which has been brought back by an onslaught of storms and could cause lot of damage in spring.</p>

<h3>Trump Flourishes in the Glare of His Indictment</h3>

<p>The former president’s appetite for attention has been fundamental to his identity for decades. Where others may focus on the hazards of a criminal case, he raises money, promotes his campaign and works to reduce the case to a cliffhanging spectacle.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Zz3uv1"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
