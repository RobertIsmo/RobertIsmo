<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there seems to be a lot happening in the world. There was an uproar over the ousting of Sam Altman as the head of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence start-up, and talks of his return are underway. In Israel, officials have been trying to end Hamas&#39; control using a military strategy and international condemnation for civilian casualties is rising. There&#39;s also a lot happening in Gaza where thousands of children have been killed since Israel launched its assault. Moreover, companies are boycotting X for its endorsement of an antisemitic post and African artists are driving a cultural renaissance. In the US, Pardon Recipients are trying to involve Trump in his own sentencing law to boost Black voter support. In the real estate sector, a recent ruling has potential to transform home buying and selling. In Colombia, they&#39;re sterilizing Pablo Escobar&#39;s &quot;cocaine hippos&quot; since his drug empire brought around 170 now roaming the country. Finally, McDonald&#39;s is getting into fashion and there&#39;s been an investigation into fake online reviews and Russell Brand&#39;s alternate reality antics. It&#39;s been an eventful week!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
