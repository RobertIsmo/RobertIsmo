<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a really eventful week in the world! In the US, there are debates over gun policy and debt ceiling deals changing federal spending. In Florida, Elon Musk had a meeting with Ron DeSantis which exposed Twitter&#39;s technical glitches. There was a cross-border raid by Russian fighters based in Ukraine to force Moscow to divert its soldiers from the battlefield. In Capitols and Courtrooms, no end in sight for US national divide over gun policy. Tina Turner, the magnetic singer of explosive power sadly passed away at 83. A paralyzed man has been able to walk again with groundbreaking brain and spine implants. Lastly in Soho NYC, there is a renovation skirmish between two rich magnates.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
