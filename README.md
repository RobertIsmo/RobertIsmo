<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening globally. Microsoft recently hired the former CEO of OpenAI, an artificial intelligence company. In Argentina, a far-right president has recently been elected and Rosalynn Carter has passed away at 96. In America, the government is becoming increasingly dependent on the technology provided by a single technologist even though they have publicly announced their disapproval of his views. Meanwhile, relations between Israelis and Palestinians are worsening, leading to conflicts over hostages taken in recent attacks. Governments around the world are also starting to recognize climate change as an issue, although much more needs to be done to address it in order to keep temperatures relatively safe. Lastly, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd J Jamala recently visited Ukraine as a gesture of solidarity despite concerns about military aid.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
