<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, there is an ongoing counteroffensive with a higher amount of soldiers getting injured, and medical posts in need of aid. In the US, President Biden is seeing improvements in the national mood towards his handling of the economy, but Ron DeSantis&#39;s Super PAC has burned through $34 million as they continue to struggle in polls. For the Republican debates, seven candidates have met the criteria and Donald Trump seems uninterested so far. Meanwhile, traditional incandescent bulbs are being barred from use as part of efforts to reduce energy consumption, but there has been some pushback to this regulation. On a more personal note, New Jersey&#39;s first Black female Lieutenant Governor recently passed away, while US Senator Sharpe James&#39; wife is reportedly under investigation for possible undisclosed gifts. There are also migrants from other parts of the world who have run out of living space due to an inadequate shelter system. Additionally, a biotech company had to settle with the family of Henrietta Lacks after profiting from her cells without seeking permission. Also recently, Fitch downgraded their rating of US finances due to &quot;debt-limit standoffs&quot; which reportedly caused erosion to its management trustworthiness. Finally, it looks like special counsel Jack Smith may be taking Donald Trump to trial on charges related to the 2020 election—this trial is being seen as necessary by many Americans.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
