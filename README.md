<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things are pretty hectic worldwide right now. U.S. lawmakers are having a tough time coming to an agreement on social security, and Joe Biden&#39;s IRS nominee is going to be grilled about a $80 billion overhaul. In Russia, a cemetery near the Black Sea is quickly filling up with soldiers from Wagner mercenary forces due to the huge casualties of their invasion. That invasion is making heavy losses for Russia and Ukraine. Over in Scotland, there’s speculation over who could succeed Nicola Sturgeon as first minister, and in China, rough estimates show that between 1 and 1.5 million people may have died due to COVID-19 – way more than the official count. In Buffalo, a gunman has been sentenced to life in prison after a relative of one of the victims tried to lunge at them during a hearing. On brighter notes, Antarctic scientists have gained more insight into melting ice shelves which will help forecast its effect on global sea level, and New Orleans chefs are rewriting history by exploring how their celebrated food owes as much to West African and Caribbean cuisines as to Creole cooking. Finally, in the U.S., there’s some heated politicking ahead of the Senate race in California, along with conversations about President Trump – who his Republican rivals seem reluctant to criticize – and a Monterey Park community of ballroom dancers who recently had to deal with a devastating mass shooting.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
