<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world recently. In the US, a prominent South Carolina lawyer was convicted of murdering his wife and son after a six-week trial. His sentencing date is coming up soon and prosecutors are seeking life in prison without the possibility of parole. Meanwhile, the Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken recently had a confrontation with his Russian counterpart about Moscow’s war againstUkraine. In Germany, Ukraine’s military is conducting war games as part of a preparation for a possible major offensive, while Russia is dealing with an armed group that briefly took control of a border town in the Bryansk region. In DC, President Biden bowed to Republicans on blocking a new criminal code that reduces some sentences. On the Canadian frontier, there has been an increase in illegal crossings from the US leading to calls to close down rural roads on the border. Finally, right here in NYC, there&#39;s an ongoing inquiry into whether George Santos violated various laws or engaged in sexual misconduct and the iconic Hotel Pennsylvania was demolished despite years of attempts to save it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
