<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot of tension in the world between Russia and Ukraine. We&#39;re seeing reports of Russian companies being unable to, or choosing not to leave Russia in the wake of their invasion of Ukraine. There has also been an incident with Russian partisans taking control of a village in Russia, after which President Vladimir V. Putin canceled a trip to be briefed on the situation. 

In the US, Joe Biden is being challenged by public support that is softening for arming Ukraine, while Congress is attempting to block an investment rule which could inevitably lead to a veto fight with the White House. In addition, Biden has just released a new cybersecurity strategy that imposes more mandates on tech companies that control most of our digital infrastructure, as well as increasing government roles in disrupt hackers and any state-sponsored entities. 

Meanwhile, Canadians are responding angrily to an influx of migrants crossing illegally into their country from the US. Furthermore, The Hotel Pennsylvania has been demolished despite its vast popularity and memorable song about it, and hybrid work is becoming more permanent as C.E.O&#39;s make their choices. Finally, restrictions on abortion pills are facing legal challenges that are aiming to shut down F.D.A.&#39;s approval of medication abortion, while photographer Tyre Nichols showcases the parts of Memphis that some residents have forgotten.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
