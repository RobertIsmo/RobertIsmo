<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been some major news happening around the world recently. In the US, rioters involved in the attack on the Capitol have been held accountable and now attention is turning to prosecuting Donald Trump. In Georgia, two defendants in a Trump case will get an early trial together. Meanwhile, Mike Pence has denounced Trump&#39;s brand of populism as a &quot;road to ruin&quot; for the Republican Party. Also, prosecutors have made their case against Peter Navarro in a contempt trial.

Elsewhere, Mexico has decriminalized abortion nationwide, with two women set to face off against one another to become president of the country for the first time ever. President Biden is also taking action regarding drilling, instituting a ban on millions of acres in Alaska and cancelling oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Justice Dept. is reportedly planning to indict Hunter Biden on a gun charge this month, too.

Finally, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting Kyiv to show support while there was a deadly attack by Russia in the region. Additionally, it&#39;s been stiflingly hot at the US Open, which has caused some players to lose their cool. Naomi Osaka isn&#39;t competing this year; she took time off for mental health reasons and to start a family with her long-term goal being to play again by 2024.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
