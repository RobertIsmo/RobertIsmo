<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been turbulent lately, both in the US and abroad. In the US, President Biden&#39;s approval ratings are lower than average for a second-year president, largely due to a struggling economy. We saw this most recently with some record high gas prices. On top of that, we saw Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the newly elected governor of Arkansas, plan a Republican response that focused on younger leaders to likely draw attention to President Biden&#39;s age (he&#39;s 80.)

Abroad, there was a major earthquake in Turkey and Syria that caused immense destruction. Rescue teams had to shovel through snow and rubble to save people, with many of the victims being children. The quake was so powerful that it was felt hundreds of miles away.

In technology, Microsoft is adding A.I. to their search engine as the industry struggles against one of its worst slumps in decades. Meanwhile, fake personas are now being used in state-aligned information campaigns, which means more online manipulation.

Lastly, Gustavo Dudamel will be leaving his post as the star maestro in Los Angeles and taking up the podium at New York Philharmonic in 2026 which will be a major coup for them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
