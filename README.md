<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a stalemate in the fight in Ukraine&#39;s Donbas region, and it looks like a patch of the Zaporizhzhia region in southeastern Ukraine could be the next big battlefield. In Hollywood, conversations between unions representing writers and actors and Hollywood companies about labor contract negotiations have sparked talk of a writers&#39; strike going into effect soon. On the other side of the United States, the governor of Montana has signed a law banning transgender care for minors, despite urgings from his nonbinary son and protests from a transgender state lawmaker. 

Also, former President Trump is facing legal jeopardy as prosecutors investigate his campaign fundraising mishaps involving possible false claims of election fraud. Meanwhile in New York, they are looking to toughen their bail law to give judges more discretion on when bail is unnecessary. Lastly, South Korea&#39;s president Yoon Suk Yeol has been seen as having polarized his country due to his foreign policy choices aligning his country with Washington and Tokyo, with some saying he gained little from those choices.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
