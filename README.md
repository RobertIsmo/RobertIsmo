<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of stories in the news lately that reflect a global, tumultuous landscape. In Morocco, an earthquake has left a remote village without power and running low on food and water. Meanwhile, in Russia, a convicted arms trader is trying to get into politics. 
In Argentina, a singer was publicly denounced for performing at the ruins of a bombed-out theater. Closer to home, in Missouri, there are reports that four years after her death, the body of a nun has not decomposed. In Iowa, the football game turned political as Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis made appearances. Governor Newsom has stepped up his support for President Biden and is encouraging other Democrats to follow suit. 
On the sports front, there&#39;s Coco Gauff who recently won the U.S. Open singles title and Djokovic up against Medvedev for the men&#39;s singles final. Lastly, here in Massachusetts, towns are welcoming but also concerned about housing around 150 migrant families. Lastly, Silicon Valley is holding back tech that can put a name to any face they can see due to privacy issues.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
