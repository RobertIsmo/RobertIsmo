<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on around the world. In the business world, Hollywood writers have gone on strike which is halting production. There was also news from the US that they might run out of cash by June 1. In fashion, people are looking back at the Met Gala from May, and planning for next year&#39;s gala in 2023. On the political front, Russian and Ukraine are escalating their attacks against each other, and tensions are high in the US Government. In music, Gordon Lightfoot, one of the most popular artists of the 1970s, just passed away at 84. And finally in technology, AI has been receiving a lot of attention lately, as some experts are raising concerns about its potential dangers.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
