<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening around the world right now. In Mexico, cities are flooded with migrants who were turned away from the US, many of them desperate. In the US, former President Donald Trump&#39;s legal team is facing setbacks as the judge ordering Vice President Mike Pence to testify in front of a grand jury investigating Mr. Trump. Donald Trump is also facing potential indictment in the hush-money probe and President Biden has sadly accepted his powerlessness to act on gun control measures without Congress. In Israel, there&#39;s been a lot of turmoil as lawmakers try to settle a plan for judicial reform, and Carlos Moreno, a professor researching urban planning concepts, is facing conspiracy theories and death threats as a result of his work. And finally, in Ukraine there are still holdouts living among ruins and explosions on the front lines despite even more destruction.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
