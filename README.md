<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it&#39;s a complicated world. In the US, there have been several mass shootings recently and the police arrested a 67-year-old suspect for one of them. People are mourning the victims and trying to figure out what can be done to stop the violence. On top of that, there&#39;s a resurgence of the Cold War, with Russia&#39;s war breathing new life into a Cold War symbol. Meanwhile in Germany, some are asking if it should become a great military power again, considering recent aggression from Russia.

In addition, governments around the world are struggling with how to pay for extremely costly medical treatments. And closer to home, people are back in lines - but they aren&#39;t waiting for Covid tests this time. Instead they&#39;re waiting for Sondheim plays and croissants and brunch! And in Pennsylvania there&#39;s a big power struggle between three factions of the Republican party who all claim to be in charge.

On the health side of things, Covid is still a major presence. An analysis in New York showed that 71% of people with long Covid needed continuing medical care or were unable to work for six months or more. The FDA has proposed that Americans get Covid booster shots each fall, similar to the yearly flu shots many people get.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
