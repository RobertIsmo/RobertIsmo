<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of unrest in parts of the world right now. In Gaza, Israel has ordered the evacuation of hospitals and thousands of sick and injured patients, leaving Doctors with impossible choices. This comes as Israelis are bracing for a ground invasion into the Gaza Strip, leading to a crisis of trust in the government. Here in the US, two Republican candidates have diverged in their attitudes towards civilians in Gaza who are bracing for the invasion. One, Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia is running for Senate, while another candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has agreed to participate in Nevada&#39;s Caucuses despite his previously criticizing them. Asides from political issues, there is also an ongoing fertilizer shortage across Africa and Asia which is creating higher food prices and malnutrition. On a lighter note, veteran actress Suzanne Somers recently passed away at age 76 after becoming famous playing &quot;the best dumb blondes that ever was done&quot; in her show Three&#39;s Company. There has also been discourse on the American Museum of Natural History facing scrutiny for holding 12000 human remains over several decades, amid accusations of abuse and racism. Lastly, people have been campaigning against policing co-workers&#39; chosen pronouns. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
