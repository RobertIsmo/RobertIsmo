<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I have some news stories about what is happening in the world today. In the US, Republican presidential candidates debated each other but mostly left the party’s front runner unscathed. Meanwhile, America has made charges of espionage against an American reporter being held in Russia. In Connecticut, there have been a lot of bear encounters so they decided to allow residents to shoot bears in certain circumstances. In China, a housing crisis has been made worse by years of government neglect. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is shaking up his legal team ahead of being booked in Atlanta. And finally, there are legal issues with the movie &#39;The Blind Side&#39; because Michael Oher says that Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy used their relationship with him to make money off his story.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
