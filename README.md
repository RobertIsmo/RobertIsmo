<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is facing charges and preparing to surrender in New York as police brace for protests. Meanwhile, a series of crucial turning points have resurrected the case against him and some G.O.P voters are experiencing fatigue as they debate whether or not to defend him. On top of that, severe storms have been causing destruction across the Midwest and South, taking several lives and leaving many injured, while President Biden visited Mississippi to survey damage. In lighter news, an unexpected upset in the NCAA Women&#39;s Final Four has Iowa defeating South Carolina and heading to the championship game. Additionally, Russia and Ukraine are both ramping up recruitment following heavy losses this winter while an American reporter detained in Russia faces additional hurdles after being charged with espionage. Lastly, Fox News has suffered a major setback in its defamation case involving false claims about Dominion Voting Systems.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
