<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot happening in the world lately. In the US, Harvard&#39;s President Claudine Gay resigned after being accused of plagiarism and widespread antisemitism on campus. In New York, Senator Robert Menendez has been charged with taking bribes from Qatar&#39;s government. In the Middle East, an Israeli strike killed a top Hamas official amid increasing fears of a wider war. In Japan, miraculously all passengers survived when a plane erupted into flames after an emergency landing. And in politics, President Trump has been barred from the primary ballot in Maine and is appealing the decision.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
