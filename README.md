<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there is a vote count to decide who will become the House Speaker and 100 years after a long drawn-out clash for the position, things feel eerily similar. There&#39;s also reports coming in of a medical emergency during an NFL game, with a Bills player beginning to recover but still critically ill. Meanwhile, the South Carolina Supreme Court has overturned the state’s six-week abortion ban, a major victory for abortion rights in the South. Further afield, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has called for a 36-hour cease-fire in Ukraine but his opponents are skeptical, while Pope Francis presided over the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI at The Vatican despite some conservative dissatisfaction. In California, people are being asked to evacuate due to powerful storms and high winds expected to last days.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
