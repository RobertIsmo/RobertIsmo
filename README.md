<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on right now in the US and around the world. In the US, there have been a lot of mass shootings recently, and many parents don&#39;t know how to respond when their children change gender identity. There were also investigators who seized classified documents from President Biden&#39;s home, and we&#39;re still getting updates on that. Meanwhile, overseas, people are living with the threat of war in Ukraine, while in Germany there&#39;s backlash over tanks being used for militarization. In another incident, Russian agents may have been involved with mailing bombs in Spain. Here at home, the government has accumulated almost $31 trillion in debt due to various tax cuts and spending increases. Also contained in the omnibus bill for December was hidden health care legislation, which covers lots of important topics like mental health and pandemic preparedness. On a different note, there was an article about the life and times of Hollywood&#39;s most hated reporter Nikki Finke who passed away recently. Lastly, here in New York City there was a trial under state laws from 9&#x2F;11 with a man accused of sowing terror overseas. And sadly, a program providing free school meals has abruptly ended as food prices increase - putting extra strain on families who were relying on it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
