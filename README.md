<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot happening in the world. In Ukraine, tensions between Russia and the West have been rising due to Russia&#39;s occupation of parts of the country. Recently, Ukraine shot down Russia&#39;s most sophisticated missile for the first time, with US-made Patriot air-defense battery. England recently had a coronation ceremony for King Charles III, which was a massive royal spectacle. There were several issues associated with the ceremony, such as the relationship between King Charles and his sons who did not seem to interact during the event. Related issues mentioned include fashion related to the coronation, and a quiz about hats at both the coronation and Kentucky Derby. In terms of politics back in the US, there is Vivek Ramaswamy who is a possible 2024 presidential contender that promises to exert an unusual amount of power if he became president. Lastly, there is also a battle between two basketball stars, Stephen Curry and LeBron James, which has redefined basketball in recent years. On top of these events, extreme weather linked to climate change is causing more power outages across the US with backup power systems being too expensive for many people.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
