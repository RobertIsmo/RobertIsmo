<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like there&#39;s a lot of division in the United States, between the Republican and Democratic parties, as well as between the urban and rural areas. There&#39;s also an ongoing debate over transgender participation in school sports. On a global level, there are some sensitive military documents that have been leaked on social media. 

Closer to home, former New York prosecutor Mark Pomerantz is being subpoenaed by House Republicans as part of an effort to protect Donald Trump, who&#39;s already been in some legal trouble after attacking a judge&#39;s family. Meanwhile, there have been revelations of undisclosed luxury vacations taken by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. 

In other news, after a school shooting in Nashville, people are grappling with the city&#39;s divisions and trying to figure out how to move forward. And over at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, Tiger Woods is struggling with a round of golf despite being injured - but three players at the first Masters tournament of 2021 have tied at the top! 

Finally, there&#39;s been a sad passing: food critic Mimi Sheraton, one of the first to disguise herself for restaurant reviews in The New York Times and overall an influential journalist for six decades, has died at 97.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software.
