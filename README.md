<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, Donald Trump&#39;s legal issues are coming to a head. A court has rejected his effort to delay a trial for fraud, and if it stands, he could lose control of some of his real estate properties. He&#39;s also not seeking to move a racketeering case from state to federal court. Biden has issued an attack on Trump, and there was a fact check of a speech he gave to autoworkers about electric vehicles. Meanwhile, there&#39;s been a lot of money spent in anti-Trump campaigns that are not having the effect intended. 

On the economic side of things, New York is rebounding for the wealthy while nearly everyone else is struggling. An impeachment hearing was held but yielded no new information on Biden. Small businesses in Washington DC that serve federal employees are bracing for an economic hit if the current shutdown continues. Finally, there&#39;s a secretive US tech firm pushing into UK healthcare with the help of pandemic aid and strong lobbying efforts.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
