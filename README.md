<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on all around us in the world. For instance, Donald Trump is in a court battle against New York&#39;s attorney general for denying he committed fraud and is facing criticism for his words and actions. He&#39;s also accused of making false claims about election cases that could potentially affect his 2024 presidential run. 

At the same time, the Supreme Court is looking into gun rights for people subject to restraining orders for domestic abuse or those who have chosen to stay away from firearms altogether. And in the Middle East, medical workers are being put up with difficult choices due to severe shortages of medicine and resources as Israeli bombings continue.

Meanwhile back here at home, Black voters are drifting towards Trump while some Democrats question whether Biden should be re-elected for president. Additionally, there are expensive and exclusive private memberships being offered to only the wealthiest New Yorkers, creating inequality within society. 

Finally, there&#39;s a beautiful beginner&#39;s guide to stargazing with the James Webb telescope which has opened our eyes to more of the universe than ever before!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
