<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Senate Republicans, notably Minority Leader McConnell, are criticizing Donald Trump&#39;s inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants, and tenants are receiving less government housing assistance as need rises. On Wall Street, investors and traders are debating if market appetite for U.S. debt is near a limit, while in West Hollywood the minimum wage is reported to be the highest in America. Elsewhere, college football fans and investors are taking over college town housing markets with short-term rentals; military aid to Ukraine has been punted to 2024, and escalating tensions in the Red Sea could cause an increase in oil prices. Meanwhile, Catholic priests are now allowed to bless same-sex couples in some countries. Lastly, there are new tests that can estimate your &quot;biological age&quot; based on your cells.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
