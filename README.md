<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, President Zelensky has replaced the Defense Minister as part of a response to Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion. The US recently sent failure-prone shells to help the Ukrainian military battle Russia, and South Africa is rebutting US charges that it provided arms to fight Ukraine. On the business side, a potential auto strike looms in Detroit at the Big 3 US auto companies, while also more strikes occurred this summer in comparison to decades past. Meanwhile, farms are consuming more water than usual in Minnesota as they cranked up powerful wells. At the Burning Man festival in Nevada on the US side of things, attendees were stuck because of rain and mud and one death was being investigated. Lastly, in Los Angeles a political brawl occurred over a City Council map, and in Florida a Judge ruled that their congressional map hurt black voters which requires state legislators to draw a new one.</p>

<h3>To Experience Paris Up Close and Personal, Plunge Into a Public Pool</h3>

<h3>How a New City Council Map of L.A. Turned Into a Political Brawl</h3>

<h3>‘War Against the Children’</h3>
<sub>By Zach Levitt, Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Simon Romero and Tim Wallace</sub>
<p>New research reveals the vast scope of the Native American boarding school system, which for more than a century removed Native children from their homes and families in an effort to assimilate them. Students at the schools gave up their names, their labor and sometimes their lives.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3qXvm0D"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
