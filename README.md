<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of international news stories happening right now. In Washington, President Zelensky from Ukraine is visiting the US to shore up support after some Republicans have spoken out against more aid for the country. In Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan have met to discuss the future of Armenian residents who don&#39;t want to come under Azerbaijani rule. At the same time, the American government is allowing nearly half a million Venezuelan migrants to work legally in the US as part of the Biden administration&#39;s plan to stop migrants heading to the American border. Meanwhile, India has suspended visas for Canadian citizens after Canada accused them of killing a Canadian citizen who supported a separatist cause. This has caused tension between India and Canada, as well as between Indian diaspora in Canada. In three Southern States, there are legal battles over political maps that experts believe disfavor Black voters. Lastly, there’s intensified fighting in Darfur between rival military factions which has had deadly consequences.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
