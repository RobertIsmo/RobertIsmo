<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In China, the property crisis has caused small businesses and workers to be owed hundreds of billions of dollars, creating economic hardship. In Spain, there has been a reckoning with misogyny after a soccer executive was accused of kissing a player without her consent. The president of Spain&#39;s soccer federation is being asked to resign in the midst of a criminal investigation. In the US, former President Trump faces a trial over his involvement in the federal election and several other political issues are sparking debate. Also, Tropical Storm Idalia is set to hit Florida as a hurricane, prompting evacuations. Finally, in Ukraine, there is an ongoing counteroffensive taking place against Russian forces that face challenging terrain.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
