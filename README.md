<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now in the US, there is a debate over whether or not Donald Trump should be allowed to remain on primary ballots for the 2024 election. Several states are in the process of suing to block him. Meanwhile, at the same time, there&#39;s an understanding that his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol may make him ineligible. 

Meanwhile in Israel and Palestine there has recently been tremendous violence. A Times investigation uncovered reports of rape, mutilation and extreme brutality against women during attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7, while Israel expressed regret for &quot;unintended harm&quot; it caused during an airstrike in central Gaza that reportedly killed dozens. The bodies of an Israeli-American couple thought to be hostages were also reported to have been killed on Oct. 7 by Hamas. 

In California, giant waves topped 30 feet and flooded beachfront neighborhoods this week, closing out a remarkable year for weather phenomena in the region. 

Finally, young Iowa Republicans are speaking up and challenging their party&#39;s stance with moderate ideas, while the Justice Department is threatening to sue Texas over a migrant arrest law it believes only it has authority over.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
