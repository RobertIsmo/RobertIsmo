<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the political landscape in the US is quite busy. Joe Biden is confronting the limits of US leverage in two conflicts, and Donald Trump is battling a lawsuit in court. WeWork has filed for bankruptcy while China is lending billions of dollars to countries in financial trouble. In terms of presidential candidates, five people have qualified for the third Republican presidential debate and Ron DeSantis has earned a big endorsement from Iowa&#39;s popular governor. Lastly, there&#39;s a quiet conversation going on across the echo chamber about war and race, with a focus on whose suffering gets recognized.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
