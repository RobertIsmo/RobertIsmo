<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news lately in the world. In the US, Congress has made history by ousting Republican politician George Santos in a historic vote. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#39;Connor passed away at 93, leaving behind a judicial legacy that is slowly being eroded by the court’s rightward shift. Israel released 240 Palestinian prisoners and detainees during a week-long pause in hostilities while inmate John Turscak was charged with attempting to murder Derek Chauvin, who is serving prison time for the murder of George Floyd. In terms of politics, questions over staffing the future Republican White House are arising: is it a paleoconservative or moderate? The campaign for second place between DeSantis and Haley is now more intense on the debate stage, while there has also been news of the effort that goes into transforming the White House for the holidays each year. Finally, stocks have hit a new high for the year after a summer swoon, rallying 10 percent from its October low with November its best month of the year.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
