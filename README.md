<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Turkey, there&#39;s an important election coming up - it could be a major turning point for Turkish politics, and US officials are watching closely. In Ukraine, they&#39;re fighting a bloody battle with Russia, while the Ukrainian president recently visited Germany to try and get more military support. 

In India, witch hunting is still an issue and people are trying to put an end to it. And here in the US, one group raised almost $90 million for veterans and law enforcement but ended up keeping it for themselves. And we&#39;ve already got 2024 on our minds - a lot of people aren&#39;t happy with their potential presidential candidates, including many Democrats who don&#39;t think their mayor is progressive enough.</p>

<h3>How to Raise $89 Million in Small Donations — And Make It Disappear</h3>
<sub>By David A. Fahrenthold, Tiff Fehr and Charlie Smart</sub>
<p>A group of conservative operatives using sophisticated robocalls raised millions of dollars from donors using pro-police and pro-veteran messages. But instead of using the money to promote issues and candidates, an analysis by The New York Times shows, nearly all the money went to pay the firms making the calls and the operatives themselves.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/42RRXZP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
