<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, many parts of the world are being impacted by a spiraling Covid crisis. In China, medical staff are severely outnumbered and working sick as their health care system buckles under the strain. However, the Chinese government is now dropping its coronavirus quarantine requirements for travelers from abroad.

Meanwhile here in the US, thousands of flights have been cancelled and thrown travelers&#39; plans into disarray, while there has been a record breaking blizzard in Western New York with up to 49 inches of snow. On a more tragic note, we&#39;re seeing more and more survivors of mass shootings having to grapple with an especially difficult holiday season this year.

In other news, George Santos, a congressman-elect from New York, has recently been revealed to have lied about his college and work history. Additionally, labor unions have raised doubts over Biden&#39;s stance on workers&#39; rights after he handled a freight rail dispute in an unexpected way. Finally, there has been an unexpected surge of migrants fleeing poverty and repression in Nicaragua - but unfortunately also reported sightings of a military database containing fingerprint and iris scans on sale on eBay!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
