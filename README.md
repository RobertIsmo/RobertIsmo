<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is preparing for what could be an even stricter immigration policy if Donald Trump wins back power in the upcoming election. There have also been talks about televising a federal election trial. Meanwhile, Iran and Saudi Arabia, two countries that usually don&#39;t see eye-to-eye, have been calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. 
In Russia, people are honoring World War II dead by trying to give them decent burials while Moscow launches missiles into Ukraine. On another note, a new insulated group of wealthy New Yorkers are creating their own world with private services.

In Greece, there&#39;s been a political shift after the ascent of Stefanos Kasselakis, Greece&#39;s first openly gay party leader. And over in Brussels, high numbers of tropical birds can be seen around the area due to an increase in population since their release from a zoo in the 1970s.
Finally, here in the US, lawmakers are trying to pass a bill that could help avoid a government shutdown while Texas bishop Joseph Strickland was removed after speaking out against Pope Francis&#39; liberal ideologies. Caregivers are also finding ways to better support each other through mentoring programs that help those just starting out and those who have had experience with dementia patients.</p>

<h3>Sweeping Raids, Giant Camps and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump’s 2025 Immigration Plans</h3>

<p>If he regains power, Donald Trump wants not only to revive some of the immigration policies criticized as draconian during his presidency, but expand and toughen them.  <a href=""><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Trump Takes Veterans Day Speech in a Very Different Direction</h3>

<h3>Trump Asks Judge to Televise Federal Election Trial</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
