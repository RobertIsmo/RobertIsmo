<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the job market is heating up - people are now earning double the federal minimum wage, and even teenagers are getting higher wages. Meanwhile, in Japan, there&#39;s a new book that argues for &quot;degrowth communism&quot; as a way for the country to reinvigorate its economy.

In U.S. politics, there&#39;s a big Republican debate coming up with major potential implications for the 2024 presidential election. And candidates have already started spending heavily on ads ahead of this debate in order to introduce themselves to as many voters as possible - including ad campaigns from Donald Trump looking forward to a matchup with President Biden.

In other news, Russian state messaging has been using military service promotions to appeal to a sense of manliness and prestige. And Washington University is struggling to provide mental health care to patients at its youth gender clinic in St. Louis due to an influx of new patients at the clinic.

Finally, the race is on for private companies and agencies alike to land - or crash - on the moon safely. As for Trump himself, he&#39;s been highly critical of Joe Biden Jr.&#39;s son&#39;s overseas dealmaking, despite his own family having done plenty of their own such deals. And in a related court case about Trump documents, one witness changed lawyers and subsequently their testimony has caused some legal conflicts. Lastly, here on Earth, firefighters left a contained scene in Lahaina too soon only for it to become an inferno moments later -- leaving some residents alarmed that someone should have stayed instead.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
