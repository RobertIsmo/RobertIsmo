<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world, there is a lot happening. The only border crossing for aid between Syria and Turkey is closed, causing difficulty in the delivery of aid to Syria. In Turkey, earthquakes are a common occurrence due to the Anatolian Fault System. A professional soccer player in Turkey was recently rescued from the rubble of an earthquake. In terms of US politics, Joe Biden&#39;s approval ratings have been low due to a struggling economy and high gas prices. He is giving a State of the Union speech soon. On the business front, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell struck a wary note about Biden&#39;s celebratory embrace of an economic recovery. The US&#39;s deficit continues to surge towards a trillion dollars as well. In arts news, Gustavo Dudamel, a superstar conductor, is taking over the podium for the New York Philharmonic in 2026. On the technology front, Microsoft is having a coming out party for artificial intelligence. Lastly, candy hearts are looking smarter and more timely than ever with the messages they carry about our lives and loves.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
