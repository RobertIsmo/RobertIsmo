<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, former US President Donald Trump was accused of insurrection by a House Jan. 6 committee and referred to the Justice Department. There&#39;s also been a lot of controversy over claims that Rep.-elect George Santos misrepresented himself in his résumé. In the business sector, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, has faced extradition after a chaotic hearing. The situation in Ukraine is heating up too, as Russia and Ukraine engage in war in various battlefields - Ukraine is even asking Russian soldiers to surrender to drones. Elsewhere, Elon Musk asked for a Twitter survey about whether he should stay on as boss, and Chief Justice Roberts briefly postponed a decision banning border expulsions due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
