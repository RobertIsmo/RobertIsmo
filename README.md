<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of concerning developments around the world recently. In the US, smoky skies from Canadian wildfires are driving people indoors and putting public health at risk. In Russia, President Putin is punishing allies of a Wagner group leader. Satellite images have revealed rapid construction at a deserted military base in Belarus, which may be the new home for mercenaries who failed in a rebellion against Putin. Sadly, a missile strike in Ukraine resulted in death and destruction for people who were just trying to enjoy dinner together. Human remains believed to belong to the lost Titan have been recovered off the coast of Newfoundland. Astronomers are also picking up gravitational waves across the cosmos. 

Locally, people in NYC are voting in more moderate candidates as part of a generational power shift. The homeless shelter system is reaching an all-time high, with over 100,000 people currently living in shelters. Artificial intelligence detection tools are also being tested to see just how easy it is to fool them. And finally, Rudy Giuliani answered questions from federal prosecutors about Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to remain in power after his election loss.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
