<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. The Swiss Central Bank is saying it will backstop Ailing Credit Suisse if necessary and the Federal Reserve, as well as lawmakers, are taking a closer look at bank rules after a collapse. In the stock markets, people are shuddering at the risk that are lurking in the financial system. 

In international news, there&#39;s been conflict in Ukraine between Russia, the West and the slow rising of chatbots in the AI race because virtual assistants weren&#39;t able to take the lead. 

In terms of business, we&#39;ve been following news of Guo Wengui - a Chinese billionaire charged with financial conspiracy, and Axiom Space unveiling a new moon suit for astronaut for NASA&#39;s Artemis mission. Finally, French protesters have taken to the streets to protest against raising the retirement age before a vote on pension bill.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
