<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Odesa, Ukraine, people are facing hostility from Russia and a growing anti-Russian sentiment. Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk has become the dominant power in satellite internet technology, which has raised global alarms. In Russia, there have been drone strikes on buildings in Moscow and these attacks just keep getting worse. Portland, Oregon is going through a difficult time with street homelessness and a deadly fentanyl crisis threatening the city&#39;s progressive identity. Former US President Donald Trump is also facing financial pressure due to legal fees from his presidential campaign and is even threatening Republican senators who don&#39;t help him with vengeance. Aging questions are also being raised by Senators Dianne Feinstein and Mitch McConnell&#39;s troubling moments as Americans debate whether elected officials should retire or not. Finally, in Africa there is a domino chain of countries who use force to seize power, creating political instability for the United States.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
