<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. On the international front, NATO leaders are gathering for a summit that is being threatened by tensions over the war in Ukraine and its potential membership in the alliance. Turkish president Erdogan has also made controversial demands as Sweden makes its bid for NATO membership. In Europe, a new study suggests that last year&#39;s summer heat waves killed 61,000 people. Between Poland welcoming Ukrainian refugees and China&#39;s record-low marriage rates due to political and economic turmoil, things are changing rapidly. 

The US news is just as intriguing. President Biden celebrated international cooperation recently, but his home country is still dealing with natural disasters like flash flooding in the Northeast and extreme temperatures in the Southwest. Fox is facing legal troubles due to Tucker Carlson&#39;s promotion of an Arizona man&#39;s conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, Robert Downey Jr. is enjoying some post-Marvel acclaim. And Senator Tuberville is blocking military promotions unless the Pentagon agrees to drop a policy guaranteeing abortion services for personnel. 

In terms of international data, both the US and EU have finalized a much-needed agreement on data sharing that&#39;s been years in the making. 

So yeah - it&#39;s been a wild few months!</p>

<h3>The Case That Could Be Fox’s Next Dominion</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
