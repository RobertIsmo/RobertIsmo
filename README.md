<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To keep up with what&#39;s going on in the world, it looks like there are a few different stories happening right now. In the US, there&#39;s discussion about possible immunity for former President Donald Trump; the Colorado Supreme Court is deliberating whether Trump can stay on the ballot; and lawmakers in Wisconsin just ordered new legislative maps. Meanwhile, overseas, there was an Israeli-US citizen who was killed during an attack in October; Apple is exploring AI deals with news publishers; and a Tokyo taxi driver has been charged with running down a pigeon. Finally, many truckers across America are facing a chronic problem with finding parking spots for their trucks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
