<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of tension in the world right now. In Ukraine, there is an ongoing war that is disrupting social services and impacting public health. In the Middle East, US Secretary of State Blinken is visiting Israel and Palestine due to a recent rise in violence. Over in Italy, its population is swiftly declining due to a birthrate slump. Economically speaking, Russia is side-stepping western punishments through help from its allies, Europe’s economy is edging higher and the IMF is upgrading its global outlook as inflation decreases. Finally here in the US, President Biden plans to end the public health emergency for COVID-19 next month and Tyre Nichols&#39; parents will be attending the State of the Union address.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
