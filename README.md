<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, there have been protests against the government and recent Hamas attacks which have prompted a group of protesters to shift their efforts to helping those affected by the conflict. In the entertainment world, there is an increasingly visible schism over people&#39;s stances on Israel. In US news, Vice President Mike Pence has been facing criticism for his decision to tie himself to President Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign and now faces pressure from primary challengers as a result. Meanwhile, Matthew Perry, who was best known for his role in the TV show &quot;Friends,&quot; passed away at 54. Lastly, there are reports of migrants being directed to New York City due to its right-to-shelter policy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
