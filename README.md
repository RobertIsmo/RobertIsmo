<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of unrest happening in the world right now. In the U.S., the Biden administration is considering reinstating detention of migrant families, and Texas is being sued over its abortion ban. Meanwhile, in France, unions are vowing to bring the nation to a standstill in protest over Macron&#39;s retirement plan. In Russia, at least 16,000 Russians have died in Ukraine&#39;s conflict and there is a growing concern about the Kremlin&#39;s ability to cover up their deaths. In Israel, protests are happening over Prime Minister Netanyahu’s judiciary overhaul and it is threatening military capabilities. Additionally, Serbia&#39;s number one tennis player Novak Djokovic is pushing against the U.S. Covid Vaccine Rule so he can compete in American tournaments, and China is blaming the U.S for its problems and saying it has no other choice but to fight back against America’s containment efforts. Lastly, California is dealing with a fifth of its conifer forests “zombie” due to it becoming out of sync with the warming climate around them, and people in America seem to be obsessed with specialty ice when enjoying ice-cold drinks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
