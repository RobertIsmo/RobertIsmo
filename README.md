<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. There is a record level of migration to the US border and the US government has put in new restrictions on asylum to try to reduce it. The expiration of the Covid-19 emergency has caused a lot of mixed emotions for those who lost loved ones to the virus and experts are warning that US governments must be better prepared for the next pandemic. In addition, there is a lot of activity in terms of trade with Russia and China, with sanctions being placed on trade between the two countries and China trying to create its own chip industry to no longer rely on US supplies. Finally, Ukraine is set to participate in the Eurovision song competition this year as a sign of strength and courage despite their struggles during the war.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
