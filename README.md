<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there&#39;s a lot of political turmoil and uncertainty as the Republican party is struggling to maintain control. We&#39;re also watching the House Speaker voting process happen, and following updates on a football player who was critically injured. In other parts of the world, investigators have uncovered horrific human rights violations in Ukraine where Russian troops were stationed. Closer to home, California is dealing with their climate crisis by fighting against floods while at the same time trying to keep people safe from potential dangers from rain and wind. Lastly, President Biden just announced plans to crack down on illegal border crossings as more migrants start entering the country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
