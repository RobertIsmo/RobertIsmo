<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news in the US recently. In Memphis, five police officers have been charged with the murder of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man. Also in the US, there has been an ongoing corruption scandal in Ukraine and a rift between some big cities and rural-dominated state legislatures that appears to be getting worse. Donald Trump also launched his own social media platform called Truth Social, which is struggling to attract large brands. On the economic front, consumer spending decreased in December and the personal consumption expenditures price index was slower than the month before. Finally, New York City banned foie gras in 2019, but the debate about it continues and in the UK there is an escalating battle over a gender bill that could bolster independence movements.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
