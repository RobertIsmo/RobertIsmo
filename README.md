<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is facing a lot of instability and unrest. In Ukraine, Russia has resumed attacking and continuing their campaign of violence. A beloved Ukrainian port city, Odesa, is facing devastating consequences from the war. Meanwhile in the US, turmoil abounds. The Biden administration is facing court backlash over its policies on education and asylum. In Congress, partisan politics and distrust are rampant as Republicans continue to push for investigations into President Biden&#39;s family members. Additionally, severe wildfires have broken out across Europe and North Africa.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
