<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening around the world right now. In Europe, there is a proposal to use $300 billion in Russian assets to help Ukraine&#39;s war effort, while in the Czech Republic there was a shooting at Prague University that left 15 people dead. In the US, Rudolph Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, President Trump had his worst track record before the Supreme Court since the 1930s, and Ron DeSantis suggested Trump&#39;s legal woes made it harder for his rivals to break through in the Republican primary. Meanwhile, in Gaza, over 20,000 people have died as a result of ongoing wars with Israel. Shari Redstone, ruler of a vast media kingdom, is also weighing a sale due to financial pressures. Finally, here in New York City, there is James Kane who tosses a giant magnet into the water to fish out all kinds of things.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
