<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things are pretty busy in the world. President Biden&#39;s son has been indicted on gun charges. Also, migration policies are in flux - politicians are charging millions to have people sent to the US illegally. 
Biden has also appointed the former commerce secretary Penny Pritzker to help with Ukraine&#39;s economic recovery. In Libya there&#39;s a chaotic struggle for rescuers after a deadly flood happened there.

In entertainment, The Rolling Stones have just release their first album of new songs since 2005 and first since the death of Charlie Watts. The White House is facing an impeachment inquiry with the President trying to combat it with politics rather than law. He plans to give a speech about democracy soon too.

Chris Christie has made big bet on New Hampshire for his candidacy and Romney recently wrote a gossipy biography about his own career in politics. In Morocco, there was an earthquake that resulted in people being left homeless, scared and in some cases pregnant. Finally, in New York region there is a court case against a fisherman accused of taking too many fish from the seas of Montauk.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
