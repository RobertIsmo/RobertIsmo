<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! The US is on track to add $19 trillion in new debt over the next 10 years, and the Congressional Budget Office has warned that this could lead to default in July if Congress doesn&#39;t take action. Meanwhile, there has been rising diplomatic tension between the US and China over accusations of spying balloon flights, and in Ohio local residents are feeling uneasy after a train carrying toxic chemicals derailed. In other news, Russia&#39;s heavy losses have sparked questions regarding their ability to sustain offensive maneuvers, while emotions ran especially high at a Buffalo hearing where the gunman was sentenced to life. On a more somber note, the investigation into Pablo Neruda&#39;s death has finally concluded 10 years after his passing, revealing possible clues as to how he died. And last but not least, Hollywood icon Raquel Welch passed away at 82.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
