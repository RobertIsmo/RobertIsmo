<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, the political situation around the world is tense. In Russia, many companies have been left unable to or unwilling to leave after their invasion of Ukraine. In Ukraine itself, a former mayor&#39;s decision to stay in his post during occupation has led to some disagreement and confusion.

In the United States, President Biden is facing some challenges as public opinion starts to soften towards further involvement in the Ukrainian war effort. Also, there&#39;s a pending Supreme Court case that could define the limits of presidential power. Politicians are trying to block a rule allowing investments with social and environmental factors weighed into consideration. At the same time, Biden is putting forth a cybersecurity strategy that could make tech firms responsible for digital infrastructure.

Here in Canada, people are angrily reacting to an influx of illegal crossings from the U.S., which has led to calls to close off one rural border road.

On the lighter side, this is a record year for Asian and Asian American actors at the Academy Awards - with many contenders reflecting on their work. We&#39;re also seeing with Tyre Nichols&#39; photography how Memphis is slowly making its way back up again. 

Finally, New York state legislators are proposing an outlaw of corporal punishment in private schools after evidence was uncovered of slaps and kicks being used to keep order in some Hasidic Jewish schools.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
