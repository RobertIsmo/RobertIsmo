<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot going on in the world. In Israel, Palestinian militants recently conducted an attack that resulted in hundreds of casualties and abductions. Across the globe in Afghanistan, two powerful earthquakes have reduced entire villages to rubble and killed hundreds of people. Numerous countries, including the US and Sweden, are trying to fight climate change by utilizing renewable energy sources like wind power. In addition, strikes from various unions across different sectors have caused conflicts between employers and employees and affected other regions connected to these industries. Finally, we are also seeing a push for more public art collections, such as one in the New York City public health care system, that are rich in culture and history.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
