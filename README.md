<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the world is going through some turbulent times right now. In business, tech firms are scaling back on their operations in New York due to the economic effects of the pandemic and Russia is threatening Ukraine&#39;s exports. In politics, Biden is fighting for democracy abroad as well as creating a new monument for civil rights activist Emmett Till here in America. And internationally, Israel&#39;s Prime Minister Netanyahu has pushed through a controversial judicial overhaul while China&#39;s leadership has been shuffling around its foreign minister roles. On the health side, experts are concerned about the growing risk of pandemics from county fairs and public works are monitoring air quality from wildfires. To top it all off, scientists have found evidence suggesting this summer&#39;s heat wave is unprecedented and likely due to climate change.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
