<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, former President Donald Trump has been accused of fraud in connection with his real estate business ventures, while in New York Senator Robert Menendez has been charged with bribery. There&#39;s also a labor dispute involving the United Auto Workers union and Tesla founder Elon Musk has run into trouble with the European Union over their new policy to curb online disinformation. Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of US politicians wants stronger legal powers to clear homeless camps. Additionally, Stephen Sondheim&#39;s long-awaited final musical is about to open Thursday, and an American soldier who was detained in North Korea after crossing the inter-Korean DMZ is now in US custody.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
