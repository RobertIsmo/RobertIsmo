<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on around the world. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey is facing bribery charges for accepting cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz from Qatar in exchange for political favors. There was also a bombing in Iran that killed over 100 people, and no one has claimed responsibility. On top of that, Donald Trump is trying to get on the ballot in Colorado, and he&#39;s appealing his case to the Supreme Court. In addition, Harvard&#39;s president recently resigned after using inappropriate language. Lastly, Hamas&#39; chief strategist was killed in Lebanon recently too. So yeah, a lot is happening!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
