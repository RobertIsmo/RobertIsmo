<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on in the world lately, especially in the Middle East. Israel recently launched an intense air attack on the West Bank city of Jenin, resulting in the death of at least five Palestinians. Over in Russia, dissents are being suppressed through a growing industry of digital surveillance tools. Closer to home, Ukrainian writer Victoria Amelina passed away in a missile strike on Kramatorsk. Meanwhile at UChicago, there has been some debate over free speech and cyber bullying. 

In Canada, climate change is taking its toll with effects ranging from wildfires to other industries feeling the strain. To help prevent these disasters some countries have started offering small sums - as low as $50 - to their citizens to better protect themselves and their property before disaster strikes. 

At the US border crossings have gone down after nearly two years of increased activity, but for how long is unclear. On top of that many of those migrants that did cross are having difficulty applying for asylum due to complexities of process. 

Lastly while it may be politicized, Florida is still experiencing a boom in tourism, ranging from flag apparel to civil rights groups suggesting travelers visit there despite new laws enacted by Republican lawmakers.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Dissent, Russia Seeds a Surveillance Supply Chain</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
