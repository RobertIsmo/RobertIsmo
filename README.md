<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there is a deadlock in the House of Representatives due to a lack of agreement on who should become the speaker, which has caused a part of government to stop functioning and workers not receiving their pay. Meanwhile, the NFL is grappling with safety issues surrounding football and trying to decide how to handle its last week of the regular season and playoffs. In Ukraine, tensions are high as Russian troops battle against Ukrainian forces using cellphone signals to target them, with Ukraine claiming heavy losses from missile strikes. On a more positive note, movies are being made about the #MeToo movement and exploring what it means for victims. In California, another powerful storm is threatening people with more flooding. And here in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams is dealing with rats in an increasingly bizarre situation that has drawn criticism from those in previous administrations.</p>

<h3>Lacking a Speaker, One Part of Government Ceases to Function</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
