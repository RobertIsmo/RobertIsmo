<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot is happening in the world right now. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams is facing criticism for his response to severe weather. Meanwhile, Washington DC is facing possible government shutdown as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy calls for a vote despite not having Republican votes to move forward. Also, Senator Dianne Feinstein from California, who made major political breakthroughs as a woman, recently passed away at the age of 90. In Georgia, Trump&#39;s co-defendant has pled guilty regarding an election interference case, while the United Automobile Workers Union has expanded strikes at Ford and GM across the country. Internationally, a Sri Lankan baker has made it big in France after perfecting his craft and even baking bread for President Macron. And just recently, Navy will be testing SEALs for illicit drug use for the first time. Wildly enough, there&#39;s also this odd story out of Brooklyn about a man who&#39;s been dubbed &#39;the Pawpaw King&#39;, as he could be found growing this exotic fruit by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
