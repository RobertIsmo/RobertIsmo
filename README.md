<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening around the world right now. In the US, there are stories about how the government is adopting a new intelligence playbook to expose Russia&#39;s war plans and a criminal trial where someone has admitted to lying and stealing but denies murder. There&#39;s also a large Christian event in Kentucky with thousands of attendees. In Ukraine, people are having to constantly judge whether threats they encounter are lethal or tolerable, making it difficult to find enjoyment or hope. Globally, the earthquake in Indonesia has left many people sheltering in tents and breathing air polluted with debris from the rubble. Additionally, there is a surge of proposed clean energy initiatives but an inability to plug them in due to an overwhelmed power infrastructure. The US is also facing stormy weather this weekend across Oregon, California and Michigan that has already knocked out power for over 900,000 customers and killed a firefighter. And to top it all off, there&#39;s a story about the late journalist from Orlando who was killed while covering local news with two other men and a 9-year-old girl being injured, bringing to light the growing dangers of reporting on current events.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
