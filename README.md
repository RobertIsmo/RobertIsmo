<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is in a major political crossroads. There&#39;s an ongoing legal battle against former President Donald Trump and his allies in Georgia, as well as a recent indictment against Trump related to his efforts to overturn his election loss in the state. On top of that, US officials have said that Ukraine’s forces and firepower are misallocated and need to be concentrated along the main counteroffensive front. As for other current events, we&#39;re seeing extreme weather phenomena like wildfires, heat waves and tropical storms caused by climate change as well as multiple rescues from dangerous situations like a cable car rescuing all passengers who had been stranded for hours in Pakistan. There are also quite a few political developments going on at the moment, mainly surrounding Trump - with 2021 Republican presidential candidates running and strategists looking into how Mark Meadows pursued a legal strategy during Trump inquiries.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
