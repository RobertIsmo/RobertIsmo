<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, Israel is expanding its offensive and has asked citizens to evacuate from Gaza. On top of that, the US Navy Deatroyer shot down some drones in the Red Sea near commercial ships that are suspected to have been launched by Iranian-backed groups. People in the technology field that have felt fear towards artificial intelligence are the ones building it, while more Chinese migrants are taking dangerous journeys across the US southern border in search of a better life. Doctors and pharmacists are starting to revolt as well in response to their loss of status. Additionally, France is considering natural hydrogen for their clean energy sources while the US Supreme Court has been making rulings on granting immunity in settlements. In Taiwan, young voters frustrated with their country&#39;s leaderships are influencing the elections. Lastly, Florida&#39;s governor has suggested passing a bill to essentially supersede Obamacare; he&#39;s getting pushback from Democrats over this statement.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
