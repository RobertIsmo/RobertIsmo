<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot going on in the world right now. The Biden administration is proposing rules to ensure more electric cars and trucks on the road by 2032, and China is leading the way in developing new types of batteries. At the same time, economists are trying to figure out how to respond to inflation data, and the military in Ukraine is locked in a bloody battle to keep their strategic position. Meanwhile, college campuses (as well as Facebook&#39;s parent company) are facing morale crises due to mass layoffs and absent bosses. On top of that, Donald Trump continues to make headlines with his bills aiming to delay the trial against E. Jean Carroll and stay in the presidential race even after conviction. Finally, Montana lawmakers are having difficulty on deciding if they should ban TikTok in their state or not.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
