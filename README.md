<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension in international and domestic politics. In the US, senators are debating whether to provide more money and military assistance to Ukraine as well as trying to prevent a government shutdown. Within the US, right-wing Republicans have been successful in causing mass dysfunction, like calling for a shutdown and an impeachment. On top of that, climate change is still a major issue - there is increased water usage from oil and gas wells that threatens fragile aquifers, and there is unchecked overuse of groundwater that is endangering millions of people. In Finland, they are joining NATO after decades of going it alone, but it&#39;s becoming complex and expensive. There is also domestic news happening in the US - Senator Robert Menendez has been charged with taking bribes and is refusing to resign. Feminism advocate Caitlin Moran has ideas of how modern masculinity can be fixed, while Hollywood focuses on actors&#39; unions after getting a writers&#39; deal done. Fox News has announced a debate between two governors who are not running for the same office, while polls show low approval ratings for Joe Biden but Trump coasting through the primaries, and some San Francisco residents are frustrated with how their city is being viewed internationally due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
