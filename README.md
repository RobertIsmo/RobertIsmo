<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of different news stories circulating. Russia&#39;s President Putin is in the midst of trying to build better diplomatic and economic ties with African nations. The US economy grew at a 2.4% rate in the second quarter of this year, which suggests that worries about recession early in the year may have been premature. Trump&#39;s legal team has been meeting with prosecutors as potential election interference charges loom. There is a Justice Department civil rights investigation going on in Memphis over excessive force and unlawful stops of Black residents. Mitch McConnell is facing speculation about his future following a health episode in the Capitol. Some tributes are being paid for an underground artist known as &#39;Punk Rock Warhol.&#39; In terms of climate change, July is probably going to be Earth&#39;s warmest month ever, and the Northeast is set to start feeling some intense heat later this week. Elon Musk is looking into creating an app like those found in Asia that can do it all—from messaging to entertainment.</p>

<p>At a summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin offered free grain as he sought to shore up ties with the continent.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
