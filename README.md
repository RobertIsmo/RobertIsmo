<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>In the world, there is a lot going on right now. OpenAI recently changed leaders, with Mira Murati taking over as interim C.E.O. Meanwhile, advertisers have been fleeing a certain platform after Elon Musk faced public outcry over an antisemitic post and Israel has discovered a tunnel shaft at Gaza hospital that Hamas may be using for weapon hiding and command centers. Additionally, the conflict between Israel and Hamas has driven more attention to online antisemitism, and thousands of people are coming together in protests across New York City supporting Palestine. There is also a curious exhibition in Rome dedicated to J.R.R Tolkien that has some wondering if it&#39;s become part of the culture wars, and Nikki Haley has said she would sign a six-week abortion ban as governor if she was still in office. Finally, there is a pro-Palestinian organization at college campuses that some say has caused intimidation and antisemitism.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
