<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! President Biden and former President Trump are both visiting Michigan to court autoworkers. In Russia, a port city has been severed from the sea and young sailors are feeling adrift. To combat climate change, renewable energy sources such as solar panels are being produced more in the US, and electric vehicle owners are finding more amenities at truck stops for rest breaks. In London, people are cherishing the free parks now more than ever in the face of expensive housing costs rising. It&#39;s also coming to light that Columbia and New York University have been receiving huge tax breaks while New York City&#39;s budget tightens. There will be seven candidates attending the second Republican debate while Trump will not be attending; his legal team is accusing people of trying to strip him of his First Amendment Rights - however they&#39;re also assessing if it would be even legal to sell him a firearm.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
