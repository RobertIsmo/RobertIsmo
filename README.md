<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of political unrest lately in the US and other parts of the world. In the US, there is a rebellion in the House of Representatives against Republican leader Kevin McCarthy that has caused the House to be paralyzed for two days. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, there is a surprise development where Republicans are supporting an ex-Democrat for speaker. In Europe, Russian forces are using cellphone signals to target Ukrainian soldiers, violating many international rules and leading to heavy casualties on both sides. In addition, there have also been reports of Russian troops committing sexual violence against civilians in Ukraine. Closer to home, California is facing yet another deluge of severe flooding after a series of damaging storms that have swept through recently, prompting the state&#39;s governor to declare an emergency. Finally, in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams is clashing with aides of his predecessor Bill de Blasio over rat control and other city issues - even going so far as enlisting radio host Curtis Sliwa and his army of feral cats, to help fight off rats!</p>

<h3>Lacking a Speaker, One Part of Government Ceases to Function</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
