<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, June 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot of controversy over police presence on school campuses and the impact it could have on minority students. In Denver, school districts are bringing police officers back to their campuses against racial justice advocates&#39; objections. Meanwhile, Canadian officials have called for help from the US and other international countries to fight devastating wildfires. Here in the US, prison inmates suffer at the hands of this year&#39;s record-breaking summer heat with insufficient air conditioning. In Russia, experts say military advancements still haven&#39;t been made despite a prominent figure&#39;s departure.

On the lighter side, some family drama at the Supreme Court has everyone talking. Cindy Birdsong&#39;s relatives are trying to gain control over her care and finances by placing her in a conservatorship. Shein, an online fast-fashion company, caused a stir when they flew influencers to China to try and reverse negative accusations against them. And it looks like Koch Network is teaming up with Republicans to support Trump in 2024 - they&#39;ve already raised over $70 million for campaign efforts. Finally, two sisters in Washington opted to move in together as roommates while searching for their first apartment - but who got the better bedroom? 

Oh, and don&#39;t forget the opinion pieces! There&#39;s one about Harvard undermining itself with affirmative action against Asian applicants and another one discussing class-based admissions rather than race-based ones as an alternative solution.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
