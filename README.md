<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some interesting developments around the world recently. In Ukraine, troops are reinforcing a key location in the ongoing war, and in Finland, it looks like they may be joining NATO soon - but maybe not with Sweden. On a different note, in India digital payments have become incredibly widespread. Closer to home in the US, President Biden&#39;s power is being questioned by courts while a veto fight could be brewing over an investment rule Congress is trying to block. On top of that, Democrats in Chicago faced an unexpected divide with local Republicans taking advantage of it for possible gains in 2024. Lastly, there was a trial for a once-influential lawyer accused of murdering his own family to hide financial insecurity, and meanwhile displaced Turkish residents are being housed on a luxury cruise ship.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
