<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Odesa, Ukraine, people have a lot of hatred towards Russia due to attacks which have occurred. Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk is now hugely influential in satellite internet technology and there are some concerning implications to that. Russia is also attacking Ukraine&#39;s ports and causing distress in the country. In Portland, Oregon, there&#39;s a current homelessness crisis made worse due to fentanyl and the U.S is hunting Chinese malware that could disrupt military operations. On a different note, President Biden is trying to broker peace between Saudi Arabia and Israel while in Israel, military reservists are resigning in protest against a new law curbing judicial power. There are also reports of Lebanese depositors literally robbing banks to get their own money back due Niger completing a chain of countries taken over by force in Africa this past week which has caused even more instability in the continent.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
