<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of news happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, troops have been seen using symbols that were worn by Nazis, which could fuel Russian propaganda. The US Securities and Exchange Commission recently accused Binance, the world&#39;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, of mishandling money and lying to regulators. Additionally, there are several politicians who are entering the 2024 US race for president, including Mike Pence, as well as potential candidates who have decided not to run, like Chris Sununu. Meanwhile, a progressive scholar has announced that he will be running on a third-party ticket. Trump&#39;s lawyers have also visited the Justice Department recently, in relation to an investigation into classified documents. On the business front, people are trying to determine if the bear market is over and Twitter&#39;s US ad sales have reportedly plunged due to recent woes. India has now started running trains near the site of a devastating crash, while reports suggest that New York City&#39;s anti-crime units may be engaging in illegal tactics again.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
