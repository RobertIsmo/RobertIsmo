<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on in the world recently. On Wall Street, investors are worried about what may happen if the debt limit is breached. In politics, the Republican party is divided over issues related to the debt ceiling and the Tea Party movement is on its way out. There&#39;s been an escalation of a criminal investigation against former president Donald Trump by prosecutors in Manhattan, and criminal charges could come soon. Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords is making progress advocating for gun safety laws, and six Memphis police officers have been suspended in connection with Tyre Nichols&#39; death as more details come out about commands that Nichols was given before his death. In Russia, prison inmates are being released to fight in a war in Ukraine, and two men tried to escape to asylum in the U.S. by boat recently. There has also been a suicide bombing in Pakistan at a mosque that killed dozens of people. On a more positive note, you don&#39;t have to be complicit in today&#39;s culture of destruction if you are mindful of how you live your life according to Robin Wall Kimmerer&#39;s book &#39;Braiding Sweetgrass&#39;. Lastly, there is an opinion piece looking at how Donald Trump isn&#39;t the only one to blame for the Capitol Hill riot and how it can be used as an example to protect our democracy from future attacks.</p>

<h3>71 Commands in 13 Minutes: Officers Gave Tyre Nichols Impossible Orders</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
