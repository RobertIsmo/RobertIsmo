<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world. There&#39;s a conflict raging in Israel and Gaza, with Maps tracking the advances of the Israeli military. Meanwhile, in the US, there is an $80 Billion industry that is struggling to prevent Child Workers from being employed. There is also a huge surge of migrants along the US-Mexico border. In New York, Mayor Eric Adams is attempting to slow the migrant surge by requiring bus companies to give advance notice before trips. On a different note, Columbia University&#39;s President has avoided some of the fallout over Israel-Hamas protests. AI now has the ability to create art, but it raises ethical questions about where the power lies in creativity. In Ukraine, millions are fleeing due to war while some expatriates are determined to stay. In Mississippi there are allegations of jailhouse rape and Sheriff corruption and no one to investigate them. Lastly, US Representative Lauren Boebert just switched House Districts in Colorado and Nikki Haley was recently asked about the cause of Civil War, but she failed to mention slavery.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
