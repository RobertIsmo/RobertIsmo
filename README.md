<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In the US, Treasury Secretary Yellen has been warning of a debt limit which could cause some economic fallout if it isn&#39;t raised soon. There have been midnight calls and marathon meetings to try to prevent default. In Ukraine, their top commander is saying that a counteroffensive is imminent and in Russia, President Putin is barely addressing the war in Ukraine as time continues to run out for both sides. In Texas, Attorney General Ken Paxton is facing impeachment and relying on his conservative politics for political support. The Scripps Spelling Bee also happened recently and featured some pretty wacky words. In New York, there have been instances where lawyers have tried using artificial intelligence to help with court filings. Burhan Sönmez, president of PEN international has also been talking about the tension between politics and art in authoritarian societies. Finally, there&#39;s a runoff taking place in Turkey between President Erdogan and Kemal Kilicdaroglu that will shape the country&#39;s future. There have also been conversations around &quot;gig work&quot; becoming a negative thing instead of offering more flexibility. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening in the world right now!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
