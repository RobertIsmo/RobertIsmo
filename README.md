<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are really heating up right now in the US and around the world. In Washington, time is running out for lawmakers to pass a new spending deal before a January 19 deadline. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump continues to be the front-runner in the Republican primary for the Iowa caucus. On top of that, tensions between Iran and the West are growing, with renewed nuclear activity and proxy attacks. In terms of lighter news, the 2024 Golden Globe Awards have wrapped up and it looks like Boeing&#39;s Max 9 Jets remain grounded as airlines await inspection instructions. Finally, in New York City, we now know who has been responsible for one of the city&#39;s most ubiquitous voices - a woman!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
