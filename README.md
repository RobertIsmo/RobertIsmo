<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Chicagoans are heading to the polls to vote in a mayoral race between two Democrats with very different views on how to approach crime and social programs. At the same time, Wisconsin is preparing for an important Supreme Court election which could affect access to abortions and political maps. In Russia, a suspect has been charged with terrorism offences for killing a pro-war blogger, amid an increasingly volatile political climate for dissenters. Meanwhile, in Italy, surrogacy has emerged as a wedge issue for right-wing politicians seeking to restrict rights for same-sex couples. Lastly, New York City is on edge as they anticipate Donald Trump&#39;s response to his first indictment - although he has been found shimmying out of many legal jams here before.</p>

<h3>Here’s why Trump is not expected to have a mug shot taken.</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
