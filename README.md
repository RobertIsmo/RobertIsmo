<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of news stories in the world right now that can seem quite overwhelming. Pope Benedict XVI, one of the first modern Popes to resign, has passed away at 95. A lot of conservative Catholics in the US are mourning his death, since he was seen as a hero for them. His papacy was noted for his struggle with the clergy sexual abuse scandal and his unexpected resignation. Sadly, a lot of people criticized him for his handling of the sex abuse scandal; he worked to rid the church of what he called “filth” but was reluctant to hold bishops accountable.

Also in the US, there was recently an election where many polls inaccurately predicted the outcome and skewed the narrative of some candidates. Meanwhile, Barbara Walters died at 93 after breaking barriers as a co-host of the &quot;Today&quot; show, network evening news anchor, and creator of &quot;The View.&quot; She’ll be remembered for her pioneering work in American media and entertainment.

On a global scale, there is war being waged in Ukraine where churches are becoming tools of war used by both Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine&#39;s President has also been trying to rally his country, and its allies, around fighting for Ukraine&#39;s cause through speeches he has been giving nightly.

Finally, many technology companies like Google and Apple are offering cloud storage services so you can store photos and important documents online, but it&#39;s still recommended to keep an extra backup copy just in case. A criminology student has also just been charged with 4 murders that have happened in a college town in Idaho recently but nobody quite knows what motive was behind it yet.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
