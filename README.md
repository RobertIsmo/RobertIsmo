<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Well, there&#39;s been a devastating earthquake in southern Turkey that has killed over 21,000 people and damaged or destroyed around 200 buildings in the city of Kahramanmaras. In Romania, officials are denying that a Russian missile entered their airspace, which conflicts with a Ukrainian claim that it did. And in Kherson just across the river from Russia, life is dangerous for the mayor because the city is being shelled by the Russians nearly every hour.

In the US news, the special counsel investigating events from January 6th has subpoenaed Vice President Pence. There&#39;s also an interesting debate about welfare policy in conservative circles; some think it&#39;s time to move away from Reagan-era policies and send cash directly to families in need. There are also a lot of workers who are fighting the opioid crisis but they&#39;re severely underfunded and struggling to stay afloat.

Finally, it looks like we&#39;ll be seeing two different styles of QB play at the Super Bowl this year since Hurts and Mahomes face off as two of the first Black quarterbacks to go head to head in the big game.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
