<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the Middle East, Hamas has released a group of hostages, including a 4-year-old dual American-Israeli citizen whose parents were killed in an attack, and their family is relieved. In the US, there is an investigation into the shooting of three Palestinian men as a possible hate crime, and President Trump is being scrutinized for his controversial pardon of a drug smuggler linked to Jared and Ivanka Kushner. Additionally, US troops are still training on high risk weapons with reports of brain injuries. Finally, a battle for influence is occurring in Wagner&#39;s operations in Africa following their leader&#39;s death.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
