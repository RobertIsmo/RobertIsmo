<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, there has been a mass shooting in Allen, Texas, that left nine people dead, including the suspect. On top of this, there are increasing debates in Congress over migrant child labor. In Europe, the coronation of Charles as king was steeped in history, and in Russia, Wagner Chief has appeared to backtrack on his threat to pull fighters from Bakhmut. Additionally, in New York City a case against former president Trump is taking shape with an unconventional strategy. Lastly, 5.5 million Ukrainians have returned home after fleeing war-torn areas.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
