<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some major geopolitical tensions going on right now, especially between the US and China. There is a Chinese spy agency that has been using advanced technology to try and go up against the CIA, as both countries try to steal each other&#39;s trade secrets. There is also the ongoing conflict in Israel, with skepticism growing over their ability to dismantle the terrorist group Hamas. In Ukraine, thousands of young people have been taken away from their parents by the Russian authorities as part of the war there. Meanwhile, India is strengthening its diplomatic and defense ties with Russia despite Western pressure. Ukraine also had a major military success against Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet recently, although they still appear to have retreated in one area in the East. Back in the US, Nikki Haley is playing it safe and trailing behind Trump significantly in polls, while one of his fake electors who got charged has since agreed to cooperate with authorities for getting his charges dropped. As of this year especially, lots of powerful visuals stories and graphics have been released online to make people more aware of current events. Antony Blinken is visiting Mexico to deal with rising numbers migrants coming towards the US border. In Canada, a law was recently proposed that would allow mentally ill people to apply for assisted death. Birmingham-Southern College in Alabama has been struggling financially as of late but its not clear if they should receive a loan from public taxpayer money.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
