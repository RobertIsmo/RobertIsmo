<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I have some news about a few things going on in the world recently. In the US, Representative Kevin McCarthy announced that he would be leaving Congress at the end of the year, and President Biden has called on Congress to approve aid to Ukraine before the end of the year. Over in Europe, Ukrainian leaders are facing political frictions, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has visited the Middle East. Meanwhile, in Gaza, people are living in fear due to an ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. On a lighter note, we lost Norman Lear, a legendary comedy producer who brought us shows like “All In The Family” and changed the face of television. Finally, countries around the world are trying to figure out how best to respond to artificial intelligence and its risks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
