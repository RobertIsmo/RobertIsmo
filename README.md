<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, the Republican party is in the midst of a leaderless struggle that threatens to unravel it. At the same time, the House of Representatives have yet to be sworn in due to lack of leadership, leading to a halt in government functions such as helping constituents and passing laws. Meanwhile, there is an outpouring of support for Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin who went into cardiac arrest recently. Over in Ukraine and the Philippines, people are raising awareness about sexual crimes and discrimination experienced by members of their LGBT+ community respectively. In California, global warming has caused more intense rainfall leading to fears of flooding and a need for communities there to give rivers more room to flood. Lastly, a city at the US-Mexico border is gaining international attention as a hub of global trade.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
