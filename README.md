<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a few very newsworthy events happening around the world recently. In Maine, authorities are looking for a shooting suspect who is believed to be an Army reservist. In Israel, the government is split on how best to respond to recent attacks from Hamas militants. In Georgia, a federal judge ruled that Republicans violated a landmark civil rights law in their voting maps. Additionally, in New York, there is a case against former President Trump, with some of his allies now cooperating with the investigation.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
