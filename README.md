<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s pretty chaotic out there. The United States and Europe are at odds over a push to send F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Meanwhile, a new analysis suggests heat will likely soar to record levels in the next 5 years. This is causing far-reaching consequences for health, food security, water management and the environment. Back home, President Biden has been dealing with domestic crises while abroad. He&#39;s currently in Japan trying to reassure world leaders that a debt ceiling showdown won&#39;t upend the global economy. On top of that, South Carolina just passed a six-week abortion ban, and Texas enacted a law banning transgender medical care for children. Indonesia is even relocating its capital city to try and tackle an unsustainable future! There&#39;s also drama surrounding Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&#39;s visit to New York City, plus governments around the world are trying to ban the TikTok app due to security concerns. Lastly, stand-up comics are using heartbreaking loss as source material for ambitious shows which is pretty unique.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
