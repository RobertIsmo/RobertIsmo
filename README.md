<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like it&#39;s been a bit of a wild ride in the world lately. Tucker Carlson was abruptly dismissed from Fox News while Don Lemon was ousted from CNN. Biden is gearing up for his re-election bid as North Dakota&#39;s governor recently signed a near-total abortion ban. Russia-led United Nations meetings have been drawing West&#39;s accusations of hypocrisy, and there&#39;s been some controversy surrounding First Republic Bank due to customer deposit losses. Atlanta prosecutors are also announcing the timeline for charging decisions related to their investigation into Donald Trump. There&#39;s also some interesting new messages circulating that involve &#39;decarb bros&#39; and technology in the fight against climate change, too!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
