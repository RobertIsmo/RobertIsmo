<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There is unease in the West as Slovakia appears to be joining those sympathetic to Russian President Putin. The Supreme Court of the United States is facing a challenging docket with key issues such as Second Amendment rights, free speech online, and limits on the administrative state being debated. In California, the governor has appointed the President of Emily&#39;s List as Senator Feinstein&#39;s successor in the Senate. In Greece, a Wildfire led to some asylum seekers losing their lives due to their identities remain unknown for over a month. The McCarthy-Gaetz feud has heated up after Kevin McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass a stop-gap spending bill, which Congressman Gaetz is now trying to use to oust McCarthy. In New Jersey, businessman Wael Hana had serendipitous sweeping changes in his life after his friend start dating a powerful US senator. Additionally, former pitcher Tim Wakefield passed away at 57 after helping break the Red Sox curse in Boston in 2003 and regulator Rohit Chopra has been called &quot;reckless&quot; by bankers due to his enforcement of financial law . Finally, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce colliding with Prime-Time TV made for an interesting spectacle, but climate change still made travel uncertain this past summer season.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
