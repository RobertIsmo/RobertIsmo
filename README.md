<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of people are trying to cross the US border from Latin America due to a variety of crises and poverty that have occurred in their home countries. The US is trying to put restrictions on who gets in and an Adams administration has loosened regulations for homeless families seeking shelter. There’s still a pandemic going on and over a million people in the US have died from Covid-19. There&#39;s a criminal accused of fraud, money laundering, and lying to donors in politics. Also, pizza pop-ups are becoming really popular with portable ovens and creative recipes. Lastly, Donald Trump had an unruly town hall on CNN where he dug his heels in on his lies and avoided talking about abortion but got cheers from the GOP audience.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
