<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some tensions between the Biden administration and Senator Joe Manchin III, who may be looking to run for president, about a climate law. Putin is having difficulties with the Russian forces&#39; resources and disunity in the ranks amid a potential Ukrainian attack. Tech executives are acknowledging the need for A.I. regulation while Microsoft is claiming that their A.I. system exhibits signs of human reasoning which critics are dubious about. China has been producing electric car batteries for years and now electric vans, due to productionissues, find eager buyers. In San Francisco, there&#39;s a proposed reparations plan to bring back Black residents while certain Republicans believe gender transition care should be restricted based on the stories from a group of trans people no longer identifying as such who disagree with medical experts. Also, the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 enabled Native children to remain in tribal communities but that may change when the Supreme Court reviews it this spring. Lastly, Orna Guralnik, a couples therapist has found that her patients have been having breakthroughs in their relationships thanks to the messages behind Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
