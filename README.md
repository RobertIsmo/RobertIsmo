<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is in an interesting state right now. Financial markets are expecting a rough ride due to predictions of low inflation and interest rates not standing up. Banks are being stabilized by regulators, who feared collapse of Silicon Valley Bank could have led to other runs. Macron is risking a public backlash for pushing through a law that raises the retirement age, which has caused people to protest in Paris. In France, people are protesting over pension changes as well as Ukraine burning through ammunition in a city known as Bakhmut. Climate change is being studied by scientists and musicians creating music with melting ice, while Biden has to make decisions regarding toxic chemical rules and economic growth. Lastly, Alabama players are making NCAA tournament headlines due to a deadly shooting and the passing skills of a Princeton player honoring the late Pete Carril&#39;s legacy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
