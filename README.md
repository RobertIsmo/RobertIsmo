<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of news stories recently about violence and tension around the world. In Ukraine, there is a military battle going on between Russian forces and Ukrainian forces which has left many casualties. In the US, there have been a few mass shootings in California and Wisconsin that have left people feeling frightened and uncertain. In addition, there are natural gas shortages in China due to cold temperatures straining supplies of resources. Closer to home, many companies are laying off workers due to Covid-19, while email addresses are increasingly becoming targets for companies to track our activities online.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
