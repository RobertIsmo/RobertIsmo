<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been some scary violence happening in Lewiston, Maine recently. Someone opened fire inside a bowling alley and a bar there, and the suspect is still at large. There are also students and employees stuck at Bates College right now because the school went into lockdown and all classes were canceled yesterday.

Also, tensions have been escalating in the Middle East between Hamas and Israel. Israel&#39;s military has reportedly attacked more than 7,000 targets in Gaza since the conflict began about 3 weeks ago, while Palestinians are accusing them of targeting civilians indiscriminately. 

On the political front, America has a new House Speaker: Mike Johnson from Louisiana. He&#39;s a hard-right conservative who believes that burning fossil fuels isn&#39;t changing the climate despite all evidence to the contrary. He&#39;s also facing legal trouble with prosecutors pushing to reinstate a gag order on him in an ongoing election case. 

Meanwhile, UAW and Ford have reached a tentative contract agreement that could be beneficial to both General Motors and Stellantis if approved by union members. Lastly, some scientists are watching their life&#39;s work disappear due to climate change - it&#39;s really heartbreaking for them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
