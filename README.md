<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US government is on the brink of a potential shutdown because members of Congress are unable to agree on a plan to keep it running. This disagreement has been largely driven by hard-right Republicans in the House, who stand in opposition to Speaker Kevin McCarthy&#39;s efforts. If a compromise isn&#39;t reached soon, the public will start to feel the impacts of the shutdown.

In New York City, there was a huge storm that caused massive flooding across different areas. Scientists believe this type of weather event is becoming more and more common due to climate change, and this storm was started out as an unpredictable system.

There&#39;s also a project underway on an isolated island where scientists are trying to genetically modify mosquitoes so they can&#39;t transmit malaria anymore. It&#39;s a very ambitious undertaking and governments are wary of it since there are doubts about how successful it could be. 

Lastly, San Francisco is mourning its longtime Senator Dianne Feinstein, who recently retired from her post after many decades in politics. She led San Francisco during tumultuous times, kept the CIA accountable during torture scandals, held sway over Supreme Court nominations and more during her career. Now Governor Gavin Newsom will have to choose someone to fill her seat for the rest of her term.</p>

<h3>Government Hurtles Toward Shutdown as G.O.P. House Hunts for Last-Ditch Deal</h3>

<p>There was no clear path forward in the House to keep the government funded after hard-right Republicans defeated a stopgap measure and the speaker refused to turn to Democrats for help.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ZAEOEi"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
