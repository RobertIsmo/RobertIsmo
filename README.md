<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there&#39;s been mixed reactions to the Pittsburgh Jewish community after a jury found a suspect guilty and recommended a death sentence. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops trained by the West are having some difficulty with battle tactics. Other countries are facing their own issues - Russia is attacking ports, and Ukraine is scrambling to keep exporting grain and sunflower oil. In Canada, a couple recently discovered they were switched at birth 67 years ago and are now exploring their race-based identities. Climate change isn&#39;t slowing down anytime soon either; Antarctic sea ice has reached record low levels this year, which will have major implications for temperatures around the world. There are some creative solutions as well - concert goers are pushing boundaries of disrupting celebrity performances and even throwing objects onstage. Disney&#39;s ESPN channel is seeing profits decline, too, so that&#39;s something worth keeping an eye on as well. Finally, there&#39;s been reports of a Covid uptick and migrant overcrowding in New York City. Plus Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau just announced his separation from his wife after 18 years of marriage. It&#39;s certainly been an intense few weeks!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
