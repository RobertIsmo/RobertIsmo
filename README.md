<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy week all over the world! In the US, Congress approved legislation that narrowly avoided a government debt default. President Biden is addressing the nation on Friday regarding the deal. In business news, Treasuries have become more attractive than other forms of investment despite the potential for a default. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its interest rates unchanged at its next meeting, and debates continue in small communities over whether or not to allow large chain stores in rural areas. In Guam, many people remain without power or water a week after Typhoon Mawar devastated the US Pacific territory. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has established a huge fund to sign international soccer stars to join local teams. One man is on a mission to make running accessible to everyone, and former Vice-President Pence won&#39;t face any charges after an inquiry into documents he was involved with. Lastly, new gun control regulations have been put in place in Serbia following two mass shootings, although gun culture remains deeply rooted in society there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
