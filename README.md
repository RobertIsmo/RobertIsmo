<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot happening. In Israel, people are protesting after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired the defense minister over plans to weaken the judiciary system. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, thousands of ex-prisoners are fighting and dying - with many being honored as heroes by Russia. 

In the tech world, Twitter&#39;s source code was leaked online and Elon Musk values the company at $20 billion after taking it private. Apple is about to release their new augmented reality headset and employees are questioning if that makes sense for their company. 

Sports wise, Miami and San Diego State are going into the Final Four and L.S.U. made it too despite an off shooting night. 

Here in the U.S., a couple and their 14 year old son were killed as a tornado hit their town. Hotel room cleaning is becoming more of an opt-in clean rather than a required element these days due to the pandemic. 

In China, marriage rates have declined while &#39;bride prices&#39; have gone up since they enacted the one-child policy which led to too few women. Additionally, in Los Angeles millionaires are rushing to sell their mansions before the city&#39;s &quot;mansion tax&quot; kicks in at April 1st. 

And finally, in Italy there&#39;s an annual festival where citizens throw 900 tons of oranges at each other!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
