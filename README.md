<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot has been happening in the US recently. The Justice Department has charged Donald Trump with documents case, and now he faces federal charges - the first time a former president ever has. It all started because of his criticism of Hillary Clinton&#39;s handling of sensitive information - and now it threatens his chances of getting his job back. There&#39;s also been some controversy around materials stored by him at Mar-a-Lago, which were accessible to guests. And in terms of Supreme Court rulings, there&#39;ve been some big decisions made on abortion, guns, religion and climate change - and others that could affect voting rights laws in other states. Meanwhile, Ukraine appears to have mounted a counterattack against Russian occupiers. On the business front, energy drinks are gaining popularity - but they come with a high amount of caffeine. And there was also upheaval within the House about extreme right-wingers and their effect on legislation, leaving the speaker in a tough position. Finally, Pat Robertson, celebrity minister and one of the founding members of the religious right&#39;s political power model, passed away this week.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
