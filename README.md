<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world have been chaotic and difficult lately. Southwest Airlines is struggling after a major winter storm caused them to cancel most of their flights, leaving many travelers stranded. Western New York has also been badly affected by this blizzard, with 8 more deaths reported recently. We&#39;ve seen numerous travel meltdowns over the holiday weekend due to flight delays and cancellations. In China, medical staff have been overwhelmed from a Covid crisis that has spiraled out of control. On the brighter side, new scientific results from the Webb Telescope are coming back better than expected, and Disney&#39;s iconic character &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; will enter the public domain soon. There have also been some concerning developments - a man was recently sentenced to 16 years for plotting to kidnap Michigan&#39;s governor, Russian soldiers are being sent off to fight with no surge of public outrage, and a military database of fingerprints and iris scans was found for sale on eBay.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
