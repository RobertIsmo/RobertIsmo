<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is dealing with a lot at the moment. In the US, a Supreme Court decision on affirmative action and student loans has given Democrats an opening to make a case on class and appeal to voters. Meanwhile, France is in turmoil after the police shooting of a 17-year-old led to unrest across the country, further deepening divisions between law-and-order and those identifying racism in police violence. Away from politics, it&#39;s also been an incredibly hot summer in the South, messing with people&#39;s routines. 

In other news, a migrant ship was recently doomed off the coast of Europe with hundreds of deaths being seen as preventable. Additionally, China and Russia are involved in developments as Wagner troops are ready for arrival in Belarus and China&#39;s company ByteDance is beginning to publish books. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
