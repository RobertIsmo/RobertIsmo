<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of changes to the world recently. The US has shifted to a &quot;peacetime&quot; mode now that the Covid-19 public health emergency is coming to an end. In New York, some services, such as mobile testing sites, will still be ending, but others such as free vaccines and Paxlovid will continue for a while. There is also a criminal investigation happening involving George Santos, a first-term Republican congressman. In other news, Donald Trump was found guilty in a sexual abuse and defamation case in a jury trial and he must now pay out $5 million. There has also been a move to make live shopping more popular in the US through start-ups and big tech names. In Ukraine, Kherson had been liberated but it has now turned into a kill zone. On top of that, President Biden is looking for a way to avoid default on the US debt limit with Republican leaders. Finally, Tucker Carlson announced that he will be starting his own show on Twitter after his negotiations with Fox News seem to have broken down. Some Democrats are worried that the Biden campaign isn’t showing enough urgency ahead of the 2024 election against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
