<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! The G7 leaders are meeting to discuss a novel effort to stabilize global oil markets and punish Russia, and how to approach regulating generative artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, China is hosting their own summit with leaders from five countries in Central Asia. In Ukraine, the war has impacted teenagers who have lost out on normal teenage experiences. There is also a conflict among Ukraine&#39;s allies about whether or not to send F-16 fighters. On the gender issues front, an anonymous #MeToo source just went public with her story about sexual harassment in the workplace. In science news, researchers have created a 3D digital twin of the Titanic. In technology, there&#39;s an AI boom and companies popping up to detect machine-made content. Lastly, in Los Angeles there is a queer community creating a space of safety and intimacy for themselves, while the US military has revealed that they knew an airman was mishandling classified information before his arrest and now the Supreme Court ruled against Andy Warhol in a copyright case.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
