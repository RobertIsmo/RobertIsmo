<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. There is a deal between Israel and Hamas that involve hostages being released. Israeli forces have detained the head of Al-Shifa Hospital as he was evacuating to the south. And there are families abroad who are worried and feeling guilty about their relatives living in the Gaza Strip. In addition, retailers are having mixed feelings heading into Black Friday. We&#39;re also seeing a lot of far-right conspiracy theories circling around from the video feeds from January 6th Capitol attack. However, Thanksgiving is still around the corner and there are still puzzles and ways to clean up afterwards like a pro. On top of all that, Finland is tightening border restrictions with Russia due to more migrants and asylum seekers arriving, while Putin&#39;s upcoming election starts to become more significant since the invasion of Ukraine. Lastly, there is a generous man in New Hampshire who left millions of dollars to his hometown in his will.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
