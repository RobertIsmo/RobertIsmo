<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems that there is a lot of social unrest and turmoil happening in the United States right now. There has been a challenge to the leader of the Republican National Committee after the party&#39;s poor midterm performance, and a man was sentenced to nearly 7 years in prison for firing pepper spray at an officer during the Capitol riot. In Memphis, there have been protests over the death of Tyre Nichols, who had a mistrust of government systems according to social media posts. A suspect recently admitted and showed no remorse after an attack on Paul Pelosi in which a hammer was used. There was also an attack in an East Jerusalem Jewish area that killed 7 people. Additionally, there is a &quot;bone rush&quot; where scuba divers are searching for mammoth tusks that might be in the East River. Lastly, Congress wants answers from the executive branch on why they are not as careful with classified information as everyone is supposed to be.</p>

<h3>Memphis Had Avoided Most Volatile Eruptions Over Policing. Until Now.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
