<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of big issues in the news lately. In Pakistan, there was a massive terrorist attack that left over 100 people dead and raised fears of a potential new wave of militancy. Closer to home, Republicans in Congress seem to be using the pandemic as a political weapon while they refuse to provide details on what spending cuts they want. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is promoting an education proposal that will mandate courses in Western civilization and reduce tenure. Meanwhile, in New York, there are investigations into an ex-detective&#39;s botched prosecution and Representative George Santos&#39;s campaign finances. In France, small businesses are concerned about pension changes being proposed by their government. In Alaska, the administration is expected to endorse limited drilling for a project which could have major environmental consequences. And finally, at the Supreme Court there are ethics questions around Chief Justice John Roberts&#39;s wife and her business ties that may present a conflict of interest with her husband&#39;s position.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
