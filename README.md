<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some major things going on around the world. In Brazil, they&#39;ve just inaugurated a new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, while former President Jair Bolsonaro is in Florida. Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine is beginning to have an impact on global influence and power dynamics. In the US, abortion debate is still raging, with tensions between different perspectives flaring up.

At the same time, specific individual stories are taking shape in the news. George Santos—a man accused of lying about his past—is about to be sworn into Congress in spite of the controversy. There are also people retiring from Congress after a long service who are disappointed in the current level of gridlock.

Other topics currently in the mainstream media include recovery from food waste and accomplishments from individuals like Anita Pointer—the lead singer of ‘The Pointer Sisters’ from the 80’s who has sadly passed away recently. There&#39;s also rising concern about climate change and its effects in places like Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Finally, for those ready for a positive outlook and new habits in the New Year, there are inspirational articles about trying out different kinds of workouts and thoughtfully considering Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s legacy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
