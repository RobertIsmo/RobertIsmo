<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, politicians are arguing about a military spending bill as it includes provisions on social issues such as abortion access, gender transition procedures, and diversity training. In Ukraine, settlements that were wrecked during their war have been left abandoned and now overgrown with weeds to the point where they&#39;re at risk of disappearing. On the other side of the world, Hollywood is facing its largest shutdown in 60 years due to actors and screenwriters going on strike. Back in the US, New Yorkers aren&#39;t too impressed with their mayor but instead gave praise to his newfound determination to separate from his wife. Investors are hopeful for a brighter future in the market despite companies reporting low profits - and prosecutors are questioning whether former president Donald Trump knew he had lost the election last November. Meanwhile, an insurance company in Florida is pulling out policies as insurance companies struggle to cover climate change related damage which has led to a crisis with no clear resolution.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
