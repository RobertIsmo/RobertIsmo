<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the US and Japan have been strengthening their alliance amid increasing power from China. Sanctions from the West have caused a lot of Russia&#39;s imports to travel through Georgia via truck route. In Russia, there is a rift occurring between the defense ministry and a group named Wagner. In the US, Treasury Department is expecting to use “extraordinary measures” to continue paying government obligations as they battle it out over the debt limit. Big banks are setting aside billions in order to protect against economic downfall in 2021. Special counsels appointed by Biden and Garland are creating political turmoil as Trump cries persecution. At the same time, an Idaho man has been charged with four murders that show his lack of emotion and remorse as a teen. Meanwhile, Trump Organization is being fined over 1.6 million for avoiding taxes. The Signal Peak Mine in Montana has gotten into trouble for its criminal activity, leading environmental groups to want it shut down. Lastly, fans around the world have been mourning Lisa Marie Presley at Graceland as she tragically passed away.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
