<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s been a tragic &#39;catastrophic implosion&#39; in the Atlantic Ocean that sadly cost five lives. The Navy attempted to locate the missing submersible containing the five victims, but found pieces of it on the floor 1,600 feet from the Titanic. In addition to this, director James Cameron brought up flaws in the Titan submersible&#39;s design that may have caused this disaster.

President Biden is trying to build better ties with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and held a state dinner with him at the White House—with over 380 guests. But beyond the gates things were still a bit tense.

On top of this, 3M has reached a $10.3 billion settlement in regards to claims they contaminated drinking water and G.O.P. Congressman George Santos was bailed out by his father and aunt through court records. Trump&#39;s upcoming trial could provide a conservative jury pool and missiles recently struck a bridge in Russian-occupied Crimea. 

Finally, 19-year-old French basketball star Victor Wembanyama is the most-hyped prospect since LeBron James and was just drafted number one overall by the San Antonio Spurs!</p>

<p>The vast multinational search for the missing submersible ended after pieces of it were found on the ocean floor, 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3NTDYhP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
