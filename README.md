<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on around the world. Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, the US and China&#39;s leaders, are set to meet in California and discuss ways to improve relations between the two countries. There is an ongoing conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas that has been happening for weeks. The US military is also attempting to re-establish communication with Beijing. Meanwhile, in Africa there was a massive fire that happened in Johannesburg, revealing a lot of underlying issues. And finally, people are discussing the sexual side effects of antidepressants after many patients&#39; experiences with lasting problems while coming off them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
