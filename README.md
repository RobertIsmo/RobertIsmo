<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, President Biden has been facing criticism from both centrists and liberals regarding his response to the conflict in Israel. On the international level, the Gaza-Egypt border has re-opened slightly and there is some progress being made with aid, but still much is unknown about a recent explosion at a hospital in Gaza. In Texas, communities are beginning to regret their decision to call for tougher border security measures. Meanwhile, in Russia, a dual American&#x2F;Russian citizen was detained and charged with failing to register as a foreign agent after returning there for family reasons. And finally, T magazine is releasing an issue celebrating four talents across multiple industries who have shown resilience and bravery.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
