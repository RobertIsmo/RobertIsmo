<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot happening around the world right now. In the US, Donald Trump is facing a number of criminal charges related to paying hush money to a porn star. Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence won&#39;t appeal a ruling requiring him to testify in relation to the attempted overthrow of Congress on 6 January. Speaker Kevin McCarthy has traveled to Taiwan, also with an eye towards Chinese tensions. There&#39;s been elections for Mayor in Chicago and for the Wisconsin court that may impact abortion rights. And there&#39;s been some intense weather incidents like deadly tornados in Missouri and electric car reshaping jobs in Ohio. In Europe, French President Emmanuel Macron is advocating for peace in Ukraine, while Australia is reexamining the legacy of John Joseph who was put on trial for leading a rebellion for democracy there. Finally, Augusta National golf club is hosting the Masters tournament and Mark O’Meara, who won 25 years ago, is talking about the beauty and challenge of the place.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
