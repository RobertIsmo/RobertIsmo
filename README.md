<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is happening in the world right now. For example, there&#39;s still a lot of tension between Israel and Palestine after 30 years of fighting, which experts say will remain intractable. We&#39;ve also seen tech tycoon Steve Jobs&#39; legacy continue to influence companies like OpenAI and how they are run. On the other hand, more countries are debating about the limits and risks of using autonomous weapons like killer drones, and people continue to worry about the safety of AI-controlled technology. People are also moving to the U.S. to seek refuge and asylum but are facing lots of new legal constraints under President Biden&#39;s administration. Additionally, art and photography have become increasingly popular but it remains to be seen if this trend will continue in the future. Lastly, we can look forward to lots of new book releases from The New York Times Book Reviews over the coming year, and scientists continue to study the evolution of different variants of coronavirus.</p>

<h3>Was Peace Ever Possible?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
