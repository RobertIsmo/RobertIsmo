<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the world has been dealing with a lot of different issues. In the business realm, it looks like many of the economies around the world are facing an unclear future and potential new problems that have come up since the pandemic. On the international stage, we&#39;ve seen tensions rise between countries like Russia and Ukraine as Russia is suspected of taking actions against Ukraine such as blowing up the Kakhovka dam and launching a counteroffensive against Ukraine. Closer to home, both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden have made headlines recently for different topics - Trump for certain criminal charges, and Biden for focusing on governing in spite of this. Lastly, there have also been some sports-related news such as Lionel Messi&#39;s multi-million-dollar contract with Saudi Arabia&#39;s tourism authority.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
