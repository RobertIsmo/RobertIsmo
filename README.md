<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some big changes happening in the world right now. The economy has seen a lot of job switching in recent years that have resulted in big gains for low-wage workers, but it seems like the pendulum is starting to swing back towards employers. There is also a push for &quot;second-chance hiring&quot; for ex-prisoners, and the number of job openings dipped in May to signal continued cooling. 

On the international front, the leader of Belarus has gained new prominence in Russia’s politics and NATO was planning to celebrate the arrival of a new member at their summit but it looks like that&#39;s been put on hold due to objections from Hungary and Turkey. 

Tom Brady is one celebrity dealing with the fall out from the crypto crash while transgender care bans have left families and doctors scrambling to find care across state lines. 

Finally, there are some promising developments too - like Hudson Tunnel Project which just got $6.9 billion in federal funding, allowing it to start by next year. Treasury Secretary Yellen is also visiting China to explain how the US does not intend to harm their economy while promoting export controls and tariffs.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
