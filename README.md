<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like a lot is happening in the world right now! Republican lawmakers are worried that US spending is driving up inflation, but the Fed Chair disagrees that it&#39;s the primary cause. Meanwhile on Wall Street, investors are preoccupied as interest rates rise and put balance sheets under pressure. We&#39;re also seeing a stress test for justice as the Trump investigations move ahead, and there&#39;s controversy over a hush-money case involving a former president. 

In Israel, an equally controversial law protecting their prime minister from being declared unfit to govern is causing mass protests. Over in China, tensions have been escalating with the US over TikTok&#39;s ties to its Chinese parent company. And on a less serious note, there&#39;s a strange tale of an aspiring cult leader and his missing artworks. 

Finally, some sports news-- Vegas will be the home of several college championships, thanks to the NCAA now viewing the city differently. The NCAA&#39;s round of 16 kicks off this week too and will feature some exciting matchups!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
