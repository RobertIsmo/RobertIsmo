<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of developments in American politics recently. The Supreme Court has made a few decisions that could shape how federal elections are run and how corporations can be sued in certain states. There were also some key cases the Supreme Court is still deciding. At the same time, a lot of state laws have been passing concerning transgender people, including what medical care they can access and what kind of bathroom use is allowed. There was also an audio recording contradicting Donald Trump&#39;s recent statement, and the New York court threw out a case against Ivanka Trump. On the international stage, Putin has been trying to control the narrative over a mercenary mutiny in Russia, while there are still questions about what will happen to those involved in it. Lastly, Fox News has managed to beat out &#39;The Tonight Show&#39; in ratings.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
