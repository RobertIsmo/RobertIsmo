<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
This week, a member of Russia&#39;s elite marched on his rivals in an event that has demonstrated the fragility of Vladimir V. Putin&#39;s hold over powerful individuals in the region. In New York City, a congestion pricing plan is going to be put in place that will involve charging drivers to enter Midtown Manhattan with funds going towards improving public transportation. Jenna Lyons, formerly the president of J. Crew, has joined Bravo&#39;s &quot;Real Housewives of New York City.&quot; Mark Ruffalo and Wendell Pierce are teaming up to save a Manhattan landmark from being demolished and replaced with condos. In Texas, a heat dome has been affecting the area for days and oppressive heat continues to expand from Arizona to Alabama. Educators have started testing A.I.-operated teaching bots in classrooms while doctors claim the best use for genereative A.I. is to reduce paperwork burden in healthcare. Lastly, a 23-year-old man plead guilty in court following a shooting at a Colorado L.G.B.T bar last year that resulted in five fatalities and Goodreads recently had an instance where reviews were deliberately negative for a book before its publication.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
