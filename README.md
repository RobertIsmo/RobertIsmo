<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of turmoil in the world. The Biden administration is facing pressure on how to resolve the migrant crisis and prevent a potential government shutdown due to anti-immigration measures. Venezuela has granted legal rights to over 500,000 migrants, making their way to countries such as Mexico to seek asylum which is causing huge pressures on the country. Additionally, five prisoners were released in Iran following negotiations by U.S. negotiators, showing that even adversaries can come to an agreement. In New York, narcotics were found hidden at a day care facility following renovations while in Washington D.C., President Zelensky is trying to review support for Ukraine&#39;s war against Russia by appealing not to stop sending aid and weapons. Tragedy struck in an accident involving a school bus carrying high school students when it crashed killing two people and dozens injured. Furthermore, media mogul Rupert Murdoch recently stepped down from both Fox Networks and News Corporation Boards leaving his son Lachlan as the sole leader of their global media empire.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
