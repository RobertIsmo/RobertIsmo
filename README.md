<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on in the world right now. The House recently approved a strict G.O.P. border bill, which aims to revive and make stricter some of President Trump&#39;s immigration policies. Meanwhile, some migrants have been facing difficulties getting appointments with the Border Patrol due to overcrowding. There has also been a criminal case in New York City concerning a man who was charged for killing someone else in a chokehold.

President Trump&#39;s second term goals also seem to be causing quite the stir, as he is looking to break the norms that were left untouched during his previous presidency. There is also an ongoing case concerning President Trump, where he allegedly made some &quot;vile&quot; comments on CNN that could create fresh legal trouble for him. He even joked about taking documents from the White House while on air!

In other news, scientists are shifting their surveillance to sewage data due to the ending pandemic emergency, and the U.S. has built and is mostly ok with its European-style welfare state that was created partially due to Covid-19 relief. Furthermore, Heather Armstrong has been praised as an original Influencer in regards to her blog, Dooce. 

Finally, there have been reports about Republicans caught in the middle about a debt limit fight; and a meeting between Biden and Republicans which was delayed so they can pursue a debt limit deal before the U.S defaults. A judge from Virginia has also recently struck down the federal law on age limits for buying handguns after it was challenged under the Supreme Court’s Bruen decision from 2022.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
