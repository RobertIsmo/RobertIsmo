<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there are a few big events happening that affect people around the world. In India, the population is slowly passing China, which could lead to new opportunities economically. There is also continued war and conflict in Ukraine, where Russian propaganda is confusing and worrying some residents. Meanwhile in the US, abortion remains at the forefront of debate as a pill maker sues the FDA to protect its drug and a Supreme Court decision looms. Finally, a deadly shooting in Kansas City unsettles people living there and has shining a light on &#39;stand your ground&#39; laws across the country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
