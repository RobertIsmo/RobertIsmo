<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot is happening in the world right now. In the US, South Carolina has passed a 6-week abortion ban while Texas is trying to force public schools to display the Ten Commandments. Also, Florida Governor DeSantis is poised to announce his 2024 presidential run on Twitter with Elon Musk. 

On the health front, the US Surgeon General has warned about the potential harms of social media and mental health for adolescents. Meanwhile, pro-Ukraine forces appear to have used US-made armored vehicles in an incursion into Russia - which was quickly met with retaliation from Moscow.

In other news, there&#39;s a unique school in Wales where teenage royals can take classes on world peace and an upcoming African American English Dictionary intended to preserve words created or reinvented by Black people. Lastly, this article explores a renters&#39; utopia in Vienna and how it achieved success in housing affordability.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
