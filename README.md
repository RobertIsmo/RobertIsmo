<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of international tension right now, as the US and Israel are both attempting to rally support for different political agendas. On the US side, President Biden has recently given a prime-time address in which he stressed the importance of paying a &quot;price for aggression&quot; in terms of terror and dictatorial activity. Progressive Jews have since felt let down by left-wing parties over the Israel attacks and tension continues to mount as consensus about an interim speaker stalls the House. Meanwhile, tax receipt dips have led to ballooning budgets on both sides, while Russia&#39;s promise of work has prompted a large number of Nepali refugees to take up arms for conflicting interests. On top of it all, there is a trial currently happening involving former President Donald Trump&#39;s associates which could become a threat to the former president if adequate testimony is made through plea bargains.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
