<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! President Biden recently gave a scathing speech about former President Trump, condemning him as a threat to democracy. The Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to an Idaho abortion ban that the Biden administration said conflicts with federal law. The New York Times has been tracking changes in abortion laws in every state, and Wayne LaPierre resigned from the National Rifle Association with a trial in Manhattan pending. In other news, former New York Times editor Joseph Lelyveld sadly passed away last week. On the positive side, there&#39;s speculation about which movies and actors should be nominated for Oscars this year. In Iran, terrorism exposed government vulnerability and Israel released a plan to aid postwar Gaza. And finally, Las Vegas is back open and a nor&#39;easter is bringing snow across the northeast - how much depends on where you live!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
