<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news happening around the world recently. In South Korea, the opposition leader was stabbed by a 66-year-old man, and he is now recovering from surgery. In India, despite the government investing in infrastructure, businesses and foreign investors are not increasing investment, hindering the economy from making the same progress as China&#39;s. In Britain, power grid shortages and slow planning authorities have been holding back economic growth. In Japan, a plane exploded while landing at the airport and a powerful earthquake killed 48 people. Russia has also launched several missiles towards Ukraine recently. Closer to home, there is ongoing legal action against the National Rifle Association and its leader. Finally, a total eclipse will be visible across North America this April, which will be an important moment in space exploration history.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
