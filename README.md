<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, the Supreme Court has recently rejected a theory that could have transformed American elections, and there are also still key court cases waiting to be decided. In Russia, a warlord recently took a last stab at power but was foiled by criminal charges being dropped against him. There is also a moving story about an 11-year-old boy living on the front lines of a Ukrainian town affected by war. Closer to home, audio has recently emerged that appears to contradict former President Trump&#39;s assertion he did not have classified documents and Judge Aileen Cannon has denied a request to seal the witness list in the documents case against him. Lastly, President Biden&#39;s re-election campaign might be endangered by fears of inflation and recession overshadowing his economic achievements, while new mothers are struggling with postpartum depression as they try to adjust to life with a newborn baby.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
