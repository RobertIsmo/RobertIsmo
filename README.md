<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like there&#39;s a lot of political and military tension going on around the world. In Israel, the military&#39;s failure to protect civilians from an invasion by Hamas resulted in untold destruction. In Ukraine, there&#39;s a war going on, and Danish resorts have been converted into ammunition manufacturing plants as a result. In Russia, there have been massive bombardments of missiles that managed to slip through Ukraine&#39;s air defence claiming dozens of lives. Meanwhile in China, activists are fighting against the development of new arenas that threaten to displace people living in Chinatowns. To add to all this, Artificial Intelligence has become more advanced and is prompting changes to copyright law around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
