<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the Republican party is facing internal divisions in the US Congress, with their leader trying to bargain with far-right individuals and factions. December saw strong job growth for employers in the US, which was encouraging for the economic outlook. There has also been a legal development in Idaho as details emerge in a murder case of four college students. 
In terms of technology breakthroughs, researchers are exploring artificial intelligence and consciousness in robots. Across the world, legal action is still underway as authorities keep investigating and charging those who sieged the Capitol on January 6th. The US government has also made a $3 billion package of military aid to Ukraine, including Bradley vehicles. Meanwhile Ukrainian officials view these developments positively, viewing it as a sign that key weapons will no longer be seen as taboo amongst its allies.

On the health front, a new treatment known as Leqembi has been approved by the FDA to try and treat early Alzheimer&#39;s, though there are some potential safety risks to consider. On the topic of transportation infrastructure, it looks like state governments are finding it difficult to move away from widening highways as a way to fix traffic congestion, despite evidence showing that this strategy doesn&#39;t yield desirable results for states in the long run. 
Meanwhile in sports news, there&#39;s been a huge uptick in 50-point games across the NBA lately thanks partly to more loose rules and less enforcement of defensive tactics - Donovan Mitchell even scored an incredible 71 points against Utah Jazz earlier this week!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
