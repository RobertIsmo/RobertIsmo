<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Gaza, evidence points to Israeli forces being responsible for an attack on one of the largest hospitals in the area. Meanwhile, The UN agency providing aid to Palestinian refugees has suffered 102 worker casualties. In the US, House representatives recently passed a plan to avoid a government shutdown before Thanksgiving and there have been several fights breaking out in Congress. The US and China made an agreement to reduce fossil fuel usage in favor of renewable energy, and climate change scientists are warning of health risks that are getting worse due to global warming. 
Former President Donald Trump is currently fighting for eligibility to be on the ballot for the GOP primaries in Michigan and has been issued a gag order by federal prosecutors in light of ongoing legal scrutiny. New York&#39;s mayor Eric Adams is also under investigation by the FBI due to his financial ties with Turkey. Finally, there was a new Supreme Court code of ethics issued which experts say lacks proper enforcement. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
