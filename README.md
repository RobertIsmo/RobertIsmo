<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of news happening both domestically and around the world. In the U.S., the Biden Administration is making decisions about building a stretch of border wall and deporting people to Venezuela while House Republicans are debating continued aid to Ukraine in their fight against Russia. In Ukraine, a Russian strike killed at least 51 people in a village with no military or industrial targets nearby. Meanwhile, in Russia, President Putin suggested that a plane crash be framed as involving cocaine and grenades. Norwegian author Jon Fosse recently won the Nobel Prize in Literature, while Trump endorsed Jim Jordan in the race for House Speaker, although his former fixer Michael Cohen dropped his suit against him. Lastly, Senator Dianne Feinstein was honored at her memorial with many tributes from female trailblazers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
