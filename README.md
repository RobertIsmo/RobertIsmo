<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to catch up with you and let you know what&#39;s going on in the world. It&#39;s all very scary. In Pakistan, there was an attack that killed 101 people, raising worries about a new wave of terrorism from the Pakistani Taliban. In the US, Republicans are refusing to say what spending cuts they want while trying to impose fiscal restraint in a standoff with Democrats. Meanwhile, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida is proposing to overhaul higher education, eliminating diversity programs and creating mandatory courses in Western civilization at universities.

There&#39;s also been a botched prosecution leading to a notorious former detective walking free in New York. In Ukraine, Russia is sending more troops to fight over control of a city, and in the US George Santos, a Republican representative from New York, has stepped aside from House committees after admitting to falsifying parts of his résumé. There is also an investigation into his treasurer who has since resigned.

On the health front, Navy dolphins are helping us learn some things about aging, while the US House voted to end Covid-19 precautions as Republican politicians use it for political attacks. Finally, there are ethics questions at the Supreme Court about Chief Justice Roberts&#39; wife and her business ties to law firms with cases before the court. It&#39;s all very concerning!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
