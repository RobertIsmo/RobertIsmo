<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In the US, Democratic aides in Congress are breaking with their bosses on the Israel-Hamas war, while Democrats and Republicans are trying to reach an agreement to avoid a government shutdown. The Supreme Court has just adopted an ethics code after news of gifts and travel were exposed. Current and former staff members are calling for a cease-fire in the war.            Elsewhere, Donald Trump Jr. was speaking in court about his father&#39;s properties value being inflated, and research is being done on how trees can fight climate change. Meanwhile, Tim Scott&#39;s campaign is struggling due to missteps and a missing billionaire donor, and there is pressure from former president Trump&#39;s &#39;vermin&#39; comment. In Alaska, the homeless crisis has led to an &#39;unimaginable&#39; death toll in Anchorage. Finally, Netflix&#39;s show &#39;The Crown&#39; is entering its most evocative era as it follows Diana&#39;s death in 1997.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
