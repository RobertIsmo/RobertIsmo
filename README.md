<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, some alarming news is occurring in the U.S., as federal agencies were warned of child labor risks but this was ignored or missed. On the political front, Republican Speaker McCarthy has proposed a one-year debt ceiling increase tied to spending cuts, clashing with the Biden Administration. More globally, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has revolutionized NATO military strategy and there is widespread fighting between rival factions of the military in Sudan. On the sports side, a top runner is attempting to become dominant in the marathon by moving from Kenya to Boulder, Colorado. And in business news, FOX is on trial for defamation with Dominion Voting Systems as well as a recent tax break for U.S. car companies for electric cars made here and abroad with minerals only from the US or trade allies. Lastly, over in Texas, two children survived a gunman shooting at two classrooms leaving 19 dead and those two children are still trying to recover a year later.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
