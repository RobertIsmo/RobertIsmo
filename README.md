<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there has been a lot going on in the world. In China, the population has fallen and birth rates are decreasing, which has caused a demographic crisis. At the same time, the Chinese economy has been subdued due to Covid-19 and lockdowns. In the US, restaurant workers are having to pay for their own lobbying to ensure their wages stay low. On a global level, however, there has been a push to treat HIV, but unfortunately children are not getting enough attention in this regard. 

As for tech and business news, Elon Musk&#39;s strategies have been causing controversy and he is now facing trial over alleged losses from a failed plan of his from 2018. Meanwhile in Armenia&#x2F;Azerbaijan, Russia appears weakened and unable to intervene in a renewed conflict in the region. As for returning art stolen way back in the 1800s, negotiations between Britain and Greece appear to be coming closer to a resolution. Sadly in the US there were recent shootings targeting Democrats and an ex-Republican candidate was arrested. Meanwhile in France they&#39;re trying to delay retirement with older workers facing potential discrimination when seeking jobs. However Peru is having their own problems as protests continue and their death toll rises due to disillusionment with democracy. Lastly here in California, while we appreciate beautiful views of Montecito, we also must face reality that mudslides can occur here at any time making it risky to live near here.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
