<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a heat wave happening in the Southwest US right now, with temperatures reaching as high as 110 degrees over several consecutive days and possibly breaking a record. Over the weekend, a storm system caused flash flooding along the Hudson Valley, causing at least one death. At the same time in Mississippi, a huge tornado swept through, leaving residents to deal with the destruction and decide whether to rebuild or move on. In terms of politics, President Biden recently said it is too early for Ukraine to become part of NATO as there is still ongoing conflict with Russia. On a more positive note, five members of an Azov regiment were freed from being held prisoner of war in Turkey and received a heroes&#39; welcome. Elsewhere, Yusef Salaam, who was wrongly convicted of rape and won an election afterward, is helping to inspire shift in politics about crime. In terms of health advice, experts are offering tips on how to sleep better regardless of age. Lastly, China and the US remain adversaries but are using more frequent communication to try and bridge their differences.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
