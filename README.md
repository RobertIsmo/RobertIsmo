<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of developments in the news lately. The leaders of a drug company recently condemned a ruling invalidating the FDA&#39;s approval of an abortion pill, a Democratic lawmaker was sworn back into the Tennessee House after being expelled, and a gunman killed four co-workers at a bank in Louisville while live-streaming the shooting. Meanwhile, there have been scores of mass shootings in the US this year so far, and authorities are looking for clues online regarding a large leak of classified Pentagon documents. 

In terms of economic news, the recent turmoil in banks has caused some real-world costs by squeezing borrowers and raising fears of a slow-down. There are also environmental costs to consider with Bitcoin because digital miners consume lots of electricity, sell it, and even turn it off which causes immense amounts of pollution. 

On the sports front, Aliyah Boston from South Carolina University was picked as the first pick for WNBA draft. However, women’s basketball still doesn&#39;t showcase some racial disparities in its stars. Additionally, charges were filed against the mother of 6-year-old who shot a teacher back in January, and Trump is appealing a decision which requires former Vice President Mike Pence to testify to grand jury about his efforts to stay in office during the Jan 6 incident.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
