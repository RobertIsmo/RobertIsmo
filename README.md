<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, the right-wing government is pushing forward with a controversial plan to reduce the power of the Supreme Court and citizens are threatening to shut down large parts of the economy in protest. Here in the US, Arizona has implemented a plan offering private school subsidies to every student which has often favored wealthy families. Meanwhile Russian forces have shot down drones that were targeting Moscow and blamed Ukraine, though thankfully no casualties were reported. There has also been some controversy over an old painting found in a dog walker&#39;s closet and whether it might be worth millions.

On the economic front, the US Federal Reserve is seeing historically strong employment rates due to an influx of new workers. But speaking of employment opportunities, the IRS has put a stop to surprise visits at homes and businesses due to increasing political backlash and risks to agents. On the scientific front, one astrophysicist believes he may have material from an alien spacecraft at the bottom of the ocean, though his peers are skeptical.

Finally, Republican presidential candidates are prepping for their first debate this month which could be disrupted by Donald Trump&#39;s absence, as well as &#39;Barbie&#39; movie sparking debate among all types of political figures with predictably conflicting views. And over the weekend there was an unusual pattern for blockbuster openers at the box office with several films contributing to big numbers - becoming known as &#39;Barbenheimer&#39; weekend.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
