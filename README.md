<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the United States, President Biden is facing deep anger over his solidarity with Israel from both supporters and staff members. Elsewhere in the world, a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is aiding both sides, while Pope Francis has been making changes to the Vatican and had to cancel a trip on doctor&#39;s orders. In the business world, Charles T. Munger, the wealthy vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, passed away at 99 years old. Political heavyweights gathered together to honor Rosalynn Carter for her public service after she died last week. In Ukraine, officials say that the wife of their spy chief was poisoned but is recovering in hospital.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
