<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on the world right now. In the United States, there&#39;s the ongoing legal battle involving former president Donald Trump - he has a small army of lawyers helping him with four separate federal and state criminal cases. The Democratic Group is also launching a $10 million push to protect election officials in five battleground states: Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Wisconsin. On the Republican side, we&#39;re seeing more divisions as different types of Republican voters emerge with their own priorities and opinions heading into 2024.

At the same time, in California there&#39;s been a big controversy around an Instagram account that posted racist content which has deeply divided the local community. And in Colorado, there&#39;s a debate over how to reconcile affluence and affordable housing in Colorado&#39;s Rocky Mountains, which has become more attractive to new remote workers who may not be already established in the area. 

Finally, in Hawaii, there&#39;s been devastating news relating to a wildfire that has left 111 dead - people are also asking whether it would be appropriate for people to visit even though the island relies heavily on tourist dollars.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
