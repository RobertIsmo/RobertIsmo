<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things have been heating up in the US recently. There&#39;s a potential government shutdown if Congress can&#39;t reach an agreement on a funding bill. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy has been facing a lot of pushback from some hard-right Republicans who are against the bill. In New York City, flooding and rain over the weekend caused a lot of damage to subway stations and roadways due to the city&#39;s overwhelmed drainage system, and it&#39;s looking like climate change is only going to make it worse in the future. There&#39;s also some pretty interesting progress being made in science - on a remote island, they&#39;re using genetic engineering to try to stop malaria-carrying mosquitoes from spreading the disease, and a Harvard professor is in hot water after she was accused of manipulating research data. And finally, there has been a lot of tributes to Dianne Feinstein as San Francisco mourns her brief term in the Senate and the end of her long career.</p>

<h3>Right Wing Tanks Stopgap Bill in House, Pushing Government Toward a Shutdown</h3>

<p>More than 20 hard-right Republicans defied Speaker Kevin McCarthy and defeated their own party’s bill, making a lapse in funding at midnight on Saturday all but certain.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3EX4Xnb"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>How the Shutdown Holdouts Have Antagonized McCarthy Before</h3>

<p>Some of Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s most persistent tormentors assembled Friday to defeat a stopgap spending measure to avoid a government shutdown, the latest episode in a pattern of blocking his efforts in the House.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/46bLXgD"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>How Did the Government Get to a Shutdown, and What Will It Take to Reopen?</h3>

<p>Any deal to keep it open would have to be bipartisan, since the Senate and White House are controlled by Democrats, and the House by Republicans.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/45746ek"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>With Climate Change, Smaller Storms Are Growing More Fearsome, More Often</h3>

<h3>The Gamble: Can Genetically Modified Mosquitoes End Disease?</h3>

<p>Working on a remote island, scientists think they can use genetic engineering to block a malaria-carrying species of mosquito from spreading the disease — and do it in just a few months. But governments are wary.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3PTLJoP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
