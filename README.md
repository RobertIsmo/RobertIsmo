<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, President Biden is taking steps not to comment on the ongoing legal matters relating to Donald Trump. Many GOP voters are feeling fatigued by the attempt to defend Trump and Mitch McConnell is among the few high-profile Republicans that have stayed silent on his indictment. On the economic front, certain changes to regional bank supervision during the time of Trump may have helped contribute to some of Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s downturn, while larger companies like Schwab felt a financial hit due to a panic about regional banks. 

In terms of natural disasters, there has been horrible devastation from storms in the Midwest and South, including a tornado in Little Rock that injured dozens and forced National Weather Service personnel to evacuate. President Biden visited Mississippi to survey aftermath of a deadly tornado and promised aid for affected families. 

On the sport front, Virginia Tech Hokies are headed for their first Final Four appearance thanks to junior guard Georgia Amoore&#39;s impressive talents.

Dreams of homeownership come true for many retirees who are finally investing in real estate after years of waiting. On the other hand, facial recognition technology was used incorrectly against Randall Reid resulting in an unjustified accusation and a week spent in jail.

The tension between Russia and Ukraine continues to rise as both sides step up recruitment amidst fears of upcoming fights.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
