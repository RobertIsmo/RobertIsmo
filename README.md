<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is facing some tough times right now with many major changes going on. This summer was one of the hottest on record for many parts of the U.S., which is especially stressful for the millions of Americans who are struggling to stay safe from heat exposure without proper safety standards in place. In the U.S., we&#39;re suddenly seeing a shift to cooler, autumnal weather, and there have been a lot of changes within our government too - most recently the dramatic departure of Kevin McCarthy from his position as House Speaker. The tumult has even extended to Ukraine, where there&#39;s anxiety around how their upcoming presidential election will happen in the midst of war. On a more positive note, there has been progress on some fronts: the Swedish Academy has put together a system for choosing Nobel Prize Laureates that is specific and secretive, and the UAW has secured its new leader who has vowed to fight for workers rights against powerful corporations.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
