<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of big stories in the news recently. In Texas, the state Supreme Court ruled against a woman who wanted a court-approved abortion after her fetus received a fatal diagnosis. Meanwhile in Ukraine, the US and Ukraine are looking for a new strategy together after a failed counteroffensive. The Special Counsel also sent a case to the Supreme Court to decide if Trump is immune from prosecution.

In tech, Epic Games won an antitrust court fight against Google over their Play Store. There have also been quite a few political stories lately - Inside the Penn University, donors have waged a campaign against their president and their board chairman; and at Harvard University, there&#39;s been some controversy surrounding their president and academic freedom rights. In New Haven, Yale is condemning someone who hung a Palestinian flag on a Menorah there, while Israel has reportedly been using US-supplied white phosphorus in Lebanon in October.

On top of that, Gaza is seeing an increase in infectious diseases spread due to poor sanitation and poverty while up in Yorktown Heights NY, there&#39;s been some controversy around the most lit up house on Christmas Lights Display! Finally, back in DC, Rudy Giuliani is facing millions of dollars in damages for defaming two Georgia election workers during the 2020 election.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
