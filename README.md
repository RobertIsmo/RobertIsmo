<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are some concerning events going on both domestically and abroad. In the US, a workman&#39;s mistake put many people in danger due to the prevalence of guns. On the health side, Americans are increasingly buying and using an animal tranquilizer called xylazine which is mixing with fentanyl and causing deaths. Politically, Joe Biden is gearing up for a 2020 presidential run and it looks like Israel&#39;s right-wing government could be making it hard for American democrats to defend them. On the science side, SpaceX&#39;s most powerful rocket ever blew up during its first flight but still managed to teach the team some lessons. Outside of the US, Uganda recently legalized oppressive anti-gay laws that threaten jail time for engaging in same-sex relationships. Lastly, there&#39;s a trade issue coming out of Ukraine where officials recently solved a grain blockage issue but their solution has inadvertently caused problems for other European farmers. It&#39;s a lot to keep up with.</p>

<h3>Israel’s Right-Wing Government Has Jewish Democrats at a Loss</h3>

<h3>Starship Exploded, but SpaceX Had Reason to Pop Champagne Anyway</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
