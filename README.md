<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is rising tension between the US and China. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently visited Beijing in an effort to try to prevent it from escalating further. In the US, the Trump Administration is facing legal action from researchers over attempts to squelch analyses of false claims made about the upcoming elections and other contentious issues. Additionally, there have been some news reports recently about a possible assassination plot against a CIA spy in Florida by Russia. 

On a lighter note, some Americans are experimenting with new ways to commemorate Juneteenth, which celebrates the day enslaved African Americans in Texas found out they were free. And people are moving to different parts of the country for remote work, creating economic changes in places like Austin, Texas and Salisbury, Maryland. Lastly, China&#39;s economy has unexpectedly failed to rebound quickly following relaxation of Covid-19 precautions, leading experts to scratch their heads for solutions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
