<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of interesting news happening in the world right now. In the US, a nonpartisan budget office has warned of possible default between July and September if taxes come up short without Congress taking any action on the debt limit. In another US story, residents of a town in Ohio are pressing for answers on a train derailment after they got confusing messages from government officials. In the world news, Russian balloons were shot down over Kyiv, leading to speculation that Russia is using them for reconnaissance and air defense, and Moscow&#39;s military capabilities have come into question following a failed battle for a Ukrainian city. Finally, there&#39;s ongoing mystery around the death of Chilean poet Pablo Neruda- was he murdered? 

On the lighter side, Raquel Welch, who became a &#39;60s sex symbol after donning a bikini as cavewoman in One Million Years B.C., passed away last week at 82.</p>

<h3>How a Fog of Questions Over a Spy Balloon and U.F.O.s Fed a Diplomatic Crisis</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
