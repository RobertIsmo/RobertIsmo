<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Technology is the center stage, with Elon Musk having a technical glitch during an event with the Governor of Florida. People are fact-checking claims made by a Republican candidate who recently launched his campaign for president. It&#39;s also been reported that Tina Turner, an iconic magnetic singer, has passed away at the age of 83. Over in Russia, there was a cross-border raid by Russian fighters that caused tensions to rise and has prompted some to call for war. Meanwhile in the US, there&#39;s confusion over who exactly was behind a drone attack in Russia and there are gun policy debates going on across several states. In Texas, a cemetery is currently anchoring families of victims from an elementary school shooting that happened last year. There&#39;s also been reports of Chinese malware being found on Guam - though many suspect it might be targeting Taiwan - as well as a potential debt ceiling deal that will only make small changes to federal spending. And finally, researchers have made a major breakthrough with paralyzed patients - they&#39;ve created an implant that connects the patients&#39; intentions with their physical movements, allowing them to walk again naturally!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
