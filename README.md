<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, July 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Russia, the Kremlin recently pulled out of a black sea grain deal that was seen as essential to stabilizing global food prices. Israel&#39;s president is visiting the White House, which highlights tensions between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. There is also controversy in Israel about proposed changes to the Supreme Court’s power. Here in the US, allies of former President Trump are planning to increase presidential power by 2025. Also, President Eric Adams has appointed Edward Caban as the first Latino Police Commissioner of New York City&#39;s police department. Meanwhile, China&#39;s economy has been struggling and its foreign minister has not made a public appearance for three weeks.  Finally, Wang Ping recently rowed down river where she writes her poetic verses.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
