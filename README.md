<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s lots of global news to cover! In Ukraine, the military is desperately trying to hold on to what&#39;s left of a city that&#39;s been crushed by war. Meanwhile, Poland&#39;s Prime Minister is asking South Korea for artillery shells and looking for reassurance from the US, in case China or Russia act aggressively. We also heard recently that there was almost a shoot down between Russian and British planes due to miscommunication. Closer to home, two Democrats in Tennessee have successfully been reinstated after they had initially been expelled from the House, while a Fox News trial has brought sanctions against them for withholding evidence. The Biden administration plans to switch things up too by proposing rules that two-thirds of new cars and a quarter of heavy trucks in the US will be fully electric by 2032. In other news, former President Trump is being investigated for obstruction of justice and has filed a lawsuit against one of his key witnesses. Lastly, we&#39;ve seen inflation cool off recently and the President touring his Irish heritage with family members.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
