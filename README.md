<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, a lot is happening politically, technologically, and even environmentally. On the political front, the US is facing tension with the U.N. over Israel in light of ongoing violence in Gaza. In terms of technology, the E.U. has agreed on Artificial Intelligence rules and CRISPR treatments are now available to relieve symptoms of sickle cell disease. There&#39;s also news from OPEC that members should stop any efforts to reduce fossil fuel consumption. Lastly, Michigan recently sentenced a teenager to life for a shooting that killed four classmates and classic movie star Ryan O’Neal passed away at age 82.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
