<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on right now! In the US, we&#39;ve got a government shutdown over budget disagreements, and a lot of political tensions between both parties. There&#39;s also a labor strike against the leading automakers in the US, led by the UAW. On the global front, India is dealing with a water crisis, while Ukraine and the US are disagreeing on strategies for recovering lost territory in the east. And in political news, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey has been accused of bribery and his future in government is uncertain. Finally, there are revelations from emails and other documents about President Biden that counter some GOP-led claims about him.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
