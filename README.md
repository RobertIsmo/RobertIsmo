<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot happening in the world. The West is trying to isolate Russia, and Bulgaria is sending out secret task forces to hunt for Soviet arms. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Yellen is calling for more support for Ukraine and warning China against attempting to help Russia with U.S. sanctions. Closer to home, there&#39;s a trial underway in South Carolina of a former prominent lawyer accused of murdering his wife and son as his finances fell apart. There&#39;s also an investigation underway into a train derailment in East Palestine that showed an overheating wheel bearing had been set off by an alarm. 

In terms of positive news, there&#39;s lots of government support for wind and solar projects, although getting these projects connected is taking much longer than expected. Meanwhile, R. Kelly has been sentenced to 20 years for child sex crimes, and Elizabeth Koch has launched a “Perception Box” venture which helps people self-investigate. 

Finally, there&#39;s some extreme weather across the US too - firstly an Upper Midwest snowstorm which has knocked out power in Michigan, killing one firefighter, and now California is bracing itself for a rare blizzard as winter sets in.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
