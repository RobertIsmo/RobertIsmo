<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, January 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news coming out of the US right now. There&#39;s a story of police officers abusing their power when they used violence against a man in Memphis, and another story on the murder of an East Jerusalem resident. In business news, a drug company is under fire for profiting from manipulating the US patent system. There has also been some political unrest in Ukraine, as Russia keeps changing leadership in the region. Meanwhile, back in the US, people are being faced with earthquakes related to oil production and Donald Trump is trying to get more supporters for his presidential campaign. On top of that, China saw its first decline in oil and gas demand for years due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
