<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been chaos in the US lately - there&#39;s a new Speaker of the House elected, Mike Johnson, who is a hard-right conservative. Donald Trump was recently ordered to pay $10,000 in punishment for breaking a gag order outside his civil fraud trial. And Scholastic was faulted for isolating books about race and gender in schools. Meanwhile, life continues to be incredibly difficult in Gaza as there is a lack of water and food, and one visitor described the conditions there as &#39;apocalyptic&#39;. In New York, a woman showed up with 2 goats in an effort to tell her story of despair. On a more light-hearted note, scientists tested if roosters can recognize their reflections – they can!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
