<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Republicans are facing opposition to their proposal meant to avoid a government shutdown, and the national debt has surpassed $33 trillion. Internationally, Canadian leader Justin Trudeau has accused India of a killing on Canadian soil, and there is evidence suggesting a Ukrainian missile caused a tragic event. Ukrainian President Zelensky is trying to combat corruption in his country as US President Trump heads to Detroit to woo striking union members and evade another GOP debate. Also, police have arrested a suspect in relation to an ambush shooting of a Los Angeles County deputy and Libyans are protesting for answers after floods ravage their country. Finally, scientists have devised tests for A.I. consciousness and Ghana&#39;s government is turning to the International Monetary Fund for its 17th financial rescue since 1957 due to crisis and bailout cycles. Additionally, Indian American fiction writers are reflecting on changes in America with Jhumpa Lahiri being an influence.</p>

<h3>Jhumpa Lahiri and Me</h3>

<p>Like many Indian American fiction writers working in the shadow of Jhumpa Lahiri, I had to learn that my stories could be different — in part because America was different, too.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3RHVjfZ"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
