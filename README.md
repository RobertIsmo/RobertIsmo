<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, February 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a bit of tension between the US and China caused by a discovery that a balloon flown from Montana to Kansas was labelled as an intelligence-gathering device by the Pentagon, although Beijing insists it was just a weather research balloon that had gotten off course. In the US, hiring has surged with January gaining 517,000 jobs. People are also talking about Elon Musk and his Twitter ownership which is facing two lawsuits from investors who were affected by some of his posts, and from another company which claims they rendered services for Musk’s purchase yet were never paid. Meanwhile in Memphis, Tennesee there’s outrage over an EMT service that provided no care for 19 minutes after an unarmed black man was beaten by police custody. In Europe, leaders met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to pledge more aid to help fight against Russian forces occupying some eastern cities. Lastly, people across the world are having problems with their Apple watches mistakenly sending false distress calls to 911 dispatchers. </p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
