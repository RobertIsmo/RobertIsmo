<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, April 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The Supreme Court is deciding if abortion pills should remain easily accessible. The EPA proposed the first controls on greenhouse gases from power plants. Russia’s economic officials have been enabling Putin’s war. After California&#39;s heavy rains, gold seekers are lining up to find buried treasures. Fox News has been paying out large sums for defamation cases. There’s an increased debate around school book bans. Countries are angling for a piece of Sudan’s resources. Crypto detectives are cleaning up cryptocurrency movement, and the NFL is figuring out how best to respond to players betting on games. Lastly, there&#39;s a huge blob of seaweed heading towards Florida which just keeps growing.</p>

<h3>A Chastened, Humbled Fox News? Don’t Count on It.</h3>

<p>There is little reason to think Fox News will adjust its coverage after paying a $787.5 million defamation settlement to Dominion Voting Systems.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
