<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In Israel, there is escalating conflict with Hamas as the Israeli government prepares for war. Warnings of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza have been mounting, and Palestinians are struggling to find room for the dead. Then in the US, Republicans are in chaos as they fight over who will become their party&#39;s next Speaker. At the same time, US and Qatar have just denied Iran access to $6 billion from a prisoner deal and former President Trump has recently made remarks about Hezbollah and Netanyahu that has drawn bipartisan outrage. On the other hand, President Biden is feeling the pressure of international and domestic crises, but even so is keeping an eye on American pocketbook concerns and realizing warm presidential embraces with Israel. Finally, in science news - this October, a &#39;ring of fire&#39; solar eclipse is set to sweep across much of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
