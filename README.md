<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, a lot of different things are happening. In Arizona, water supplies are rapidly dwindling due to the effects of climate change, leading to limits on construction in Phoenix. Meanwhile, a woman&#39;s family is trying to recover her spelling bee medal from 1908. There is also continued investigations into former president Donald Trump and his administration. The future of NATO and Ukrainian security is uncertain and a deadly Russian missile attack occurred in Kyiv recently. On the social and cultural front, Hannah Gadsby has curated an exhibition about Picassos&#39;s legacy, but it shortchanges women artists. Representation of California&#39;s Latino future is being previewed in one Los Angeles shopping plaza. Finally, on the opinion front, people are calling for reform of college admissions processes, there is some worry about artificial intelligence, and people are realizing that the debt disaster isn&#39;t as significant as it was once portrayed.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
