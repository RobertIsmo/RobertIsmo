<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is serious conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East, as well as tensions growing with Hezbollah. Stateside, there have been debates about Nikki Haley’s remarks on the Civil War and the push to find out more about President Trump’s ballot eligibility before Super Tuesday. Political issues are also affecting Iowa Republicans, with young voters increasingly concerned with new ideas. Additionally, cases of child labor in the US are proving difficult to uncover and uncovering locations where unaccompanied migrant children are staying. Lastly, there is the story of Stephanie Courtney, an actor who recently became a household name playing Flo from Progressive commercials. Finally, actress Milana Vayntrub has been receiving leering internet trolls since her campaigns dropped online.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
