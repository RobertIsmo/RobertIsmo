<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, tensions between China and the US are rising as the US government looks to impose new restrictions on Chinese investments. On the other side of the political spectrum, some far right members of the GOP are attempting to use a defense bill to defund efforts in Ukraine, resulting in increased partisan tensions. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has pledged long-term support towards Ukraine, while NATO leaders have expressed concerns that support may waver if power shifts in the US.

Elsewhere, the debate over equal rights amendments is being reignited as democrats use a creative legal theory to push for their passage. Meanwhile, some migrants are defying expectations by prospering in New York City despite politicians claiming it is destroying the city. In Hollywood, SAG-AFTRA is threatening to strike after failed contract negotiations. In Vermont, Tropical Storm Irene has exposed that existing flood defenses may not be enough against extreme storms caused by climate change. India is also being hard hit by monsoonal flooding, leading to evacuations and dozens of deaths in nearby states.

Finally, legal fights and racial discrimination complaints have caused turmoil within a 94-year-old civil rights organization called LULAC. While one town in England has turned their main street around by offering free rent to local businesses for two years. Meanwhile an American soccer coach is facing a defining moment as she works to lead her team to successful international showings and cement her legacy in the sport.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
