<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on in the world right now. In the U.S., we’re pouring money into tech, but even with huge investments, there may be limits to what can be done. A final rampage in Bucha left a trail of blood and devastation just hours before Russian troops withdrew from the town. And there have been a record number of discrimination complaints against schools this year that reflect the culture wars taking place in America. 

In an effort to reduce food waste, central Ohio is encouraging its citizens to eat their leftovers, while American companies are moving away from China by producing goods in Mexico. Also, Eric Adams has been battling to lead as mayor of New York City this past year, but his quickness to address urgent challenges has been brought into question. 

On the sports front, Georgia defeated Ohio State with a last-minute touchdown, and T.C.U. upset Michigan in a wild playoff semifinal that resulted in a 51-45 score. Lastly, people are using ice baths as the hottest place to network, so that&#39;s something else to think about!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
