<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like some interesting things are happening in the world right now. In the US, Trump is connecting with a different type of evangelical voter and this year, Governor Ron DeSantis won’t be as involved in the legislative session. Biden is also making a campaign trip to Charleston to address racism and extremism. On the other side of the world, there is heightened tension between the US and Iran along with conflict in Gaza. Boeing has had some safety issues that they are working to address and some of the biggest news of the night came from the Golden Globes, where Lily Gladstone made history and Jo Koy also made an appearance on stage.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
