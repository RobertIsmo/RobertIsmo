<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, October 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, Israeli forces are in Gaza fighting against Hamas. Some civilians have their phone and internet service cut off, while some Israeli protestors have shifted their focus to helping those affected by the conflict. In response, the Prime Minister of Israel apologized after blaming security chiefs for failure in Hamas attack.

Meanwhile in the US, former Vice President Mike Pence&#39;s ties with Donald Trump have come back to haunt him. Progressive Democrats who called for a cease-fire are now facing new pressure from primary challengers. 

In the arts world, we lost actor Matthew Perry at age 54. Fans and celebrities paid tribute to him and many have rewatched his best performances. 

In Maine, a gunman disclosed mental health issues to gun store owner but was denied. In Salem, Massachusetts, halloween is causing headaches due to the increased traffic and littering of tiny liquor bottles. 

Finally, TikTok has brought a new type of personalities into fame - a trucker, a shepherd and a commercial fisherman are making money due to their sponsorships on social media platforms.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
