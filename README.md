<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a few major stories in the news recently. In the US, Donald Trump and Fox News have been hit with back-to-back rebukes - Trump being criminal indicted and Fox News facing a civil trial. Across the globe, world leaders are keeping an eye on Trump&#39;s political resilience. Tornadoes recently ripped a wide trail of destruction across multiple states and killed at least 23 people. Meanwhile, in China and Ukraine, people are studying how Russia has lost and gained, as well as how to better identify friend from foe during war. Also, there was a funny story coming out of Brazil with the whole country trying to figure out what the Yankees logo means!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
