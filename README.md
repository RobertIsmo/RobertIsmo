<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been an eventful few weeks across the world. In the US, things have kicked off with a sentencing of 17 years to a leader of the Proud Boys group in connection with last year&#39;s Capitol attack, and former President Trump entering a plea of not guilty in a Georgia election interference case. The US Senate also had a bit of news with an update from Senator McConnell about his health and rumors of preparing possible successors should he have to retire. 

In terms of migration issues, US leaders have been pressuring President Biden to offer more help to those crossing the border into New York, as well as increasing attention and concerns over work permits for immigrants. On an international scale, there has been some progress on the Ukraine-Russia conflict with Ukrainian forces recapturing parts of their territories, though there are still formidable obstacles ahead. Lastly, news out of South Africa just recently brings attention to an apartment building fire in Johannesburg that has been considered a &quot;firetrap&quot; due to many safety issues and lack of affordable housing.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
