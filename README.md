<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a number of international issues happening right now. In Gaza, residents are suffering and their families abroad feel guilt and fear. There has been a deal reached to free child hostages in Gaza, however that is causing anguish as no one knows which children will make it out. In Russia, there is tension because other leaders are criticizing Putin&#39;s aggression in Ukraine. Putin is expected to run in March&#39;s election, the first since their invasion of Ukraine last year. In terms of US news, the Biden administration has created a new green energy marketplace, while off the east coast African Americans are fighting to preserve a Gullah Geechee tradition before it is erased by climate change and development.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
