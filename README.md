<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot of happenings in the political world right now. The Senate has been trying to figure out a way to provide aid to Ukraine and Israel, while President Biden is pushing for greater consideration of civilian casualties in Gaza as a result of conflict between the Israelis and Hamas. On Capitol Hill, there&#39;s been a bit of tension between Republicans and Democrats on federal military promotions and an impeachment inquiry. President Biden even recently claimed he isn&#39;t certain he would have run for election if Donald Trump had not been in office. Meanwhile, Nikki Haley continues to oscillate between backing and challenging President Trump, with speculation about her considering a presidential run in 2024 emerging. Lastly, some universities have been put under scrutiny for their handling of antisemitism and Islamophobia in their communities ever since the Hamas attack on Israel. In the Supreme Court, there&#39;s been some challenging legal cases primarily related to taxes that have come up in recent days.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
