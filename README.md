<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a few major events in the world recently. In Russia, General Evgeny Prigozhin was implicated in a plan to lead a rebellion against Vladimir Putin&#39;s government. This attracted attention from leaders around the world. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Supreme Court rejected a theory that would have given unprecedented power to state legislatures when it comes to federal elections. They also allowed an unusual Pennsylvania law which lets corporations be sued even if the suits aren&#39;t connected to the state. 

In New York, one of the Central Park 5, Yusef Salaam, appears to have a big lead in a primary for a New York City Council seat. Meanwhile, a mother who lost her son to gun violence got three minutes in court facing her son&#39;s killer. Some schools are bringing police back onto campus, reversing decisions pushed by movements for racial justice, which critics argue disproportionately targets people of color. Separately, there were conflicting accounts about how the Justice Department handled an inquiry into President Biden&#39;s son Hunter Biden and his handling of classified material. Hunter Biden has been making appearances with his father&#39;s support - something that makes some Democrats feel uneasy. Lastly, physicists have been exploring how phenomena in groups of three can cause chaos - they warn that it could potentially even lead to nuclear war.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
