<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is an ongoing debate over whether the Covid-19 virus may have come from a lab leak. Meanwhile, politics continue to sway decisions about Covid-19 treatments, especially in Florida. On the business front, the US Federal Reserve has been dealing with a Silicon Valley Bank that made incorrect assessments due to rising interest rates, and had to review its own risk management. Furthermore, UBS has agreed to buy rival Credit Suisse for a sizable amount of money. Hedge funds have been mixed in their bets on the rescue deal there. Politically, allies of former President Donald Trump are trying to pressure Florida Governor DeSantis in relation to an expected indictment. In Manhattan, prosecutors are doing their own investigation into a payoff to porn star Stormy Daniels that could potentially lead to an indictment against Trump himself. There is speculation as to what Trump could be charged with and when we will hear more news on the investigations. Finally, there&#39;s a story that touches on the larger socioeconomic crisis in America today: a tent city is forming in downtown Phoenix and even sandwich shops are struggling to stay open amidst this crisis. Lastly, here in Brooklyn, some religious communities (specifically nuns) have left due to issues like noise pollution.</p>
