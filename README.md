<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like international politics are heating up right now, as the presidents of Ukraine and the United States are facing off. European leaders are offering Ukraine more military aid, while a former US embassy employee is being held in Moscow by Russia. Here in the US, special counsel Robert Mueller&#39;s investigation has recently been in the news again. Meanwhile, Vice President Pence appears to be angling for a 2024 presidential run, while President Biden is proposing plans to create jobs that don&#39;t require college degrees. On a lighter note, there was a recent attack at congressman Gerald Connolly&#39;s office here in Virginia, while the Tony Awards will be going ahead this year after striking writers reach an agreement.  And lastly, DNA can now be extracted from just thin air. While environmental DNA research has helped conservation efforts, privacy experts are concerned about its potential to reveal intimate personal information about individuals and population groups.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
