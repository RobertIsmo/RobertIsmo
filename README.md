<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of political and economic upheaval taking place around the world. In the US, a small but vocal group of Republicans is leading a rebellion against the current Republican leader&#39;s bid for Speaker of the House, while George Santos, a newly-elected Republican who has been accused of lying about his background, is set to join the 118th Congress. In sports news, NFL player Damar Hamlin collapsed during a game due to cardiac arrest, raising questions about the safety afforded NFL players. And in Europe, natural gas prices are back to pre-invasion levels despite the ongoing warm weather. Additionally, people from Ukraine have taken to painting their experiences of living through a war in an exhibit that recently opened in Chicago. On a brighter note, research has shown that 8-minute phone calls can make us feel better and Hispanics in Florida are having some influence on its 2024 election with both Republican candidates trying to court their vote as leaders of its evangelical movement. Finally, across many industries employers have been forced to step up their training efforts as they face a higher turnover rate since the pandemic started.</p>

<h3>Who Are the Republicans Opposing McCarthy’s Speaker Bid?</h3>
<sub>By Catie Edmondson</sub>
<p>The rebellion has been led by a small but vocal group of ultraconservative Republicans. But there are other, less-known defectors who could help scuttle the G.O.P. leader’s candidacy.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Z59AEq"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
