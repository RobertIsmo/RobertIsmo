<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot is happening in the world. President Biden is calling on Republicans to help him &quot;finish the job&quot; and build the economy. In Turkey, people are desperately searching for survivors near the epicenter of a deadly earthquake. There was one remarkable but bittersweet rescue story of a man in Gaziantep hearing his brother&#39;s voice from beneath debris after a building collapsed. Meanwhile, the Turkish diaspora is rallying together in grief.

In the US, revelations have come to light that an officer texted a photo of Tyre Nichols after he was beaten. The Times tracked each officers&#39; role in their handling and beating of Nichols, which resulted in six officers being fired and charged with murder.

In sports news, LeBron James recently broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s N.B.A. scoring record and there are lots of stories about how he got there and his legacy.

Finally, there is news coming out of Russia on the Eastern Front - they have incurred heavy casualties as they rely on masses of troops to overrun Ukrainian positions for small gains.

In tech news, Microsoft is turning to artificial intelligence to create new chatbots and other types of A.I., which is one bright spot amid an industry-wide slump.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
