<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. First, Detroit automakers are facing a limited strike tomorrow as the USW (United Auto Workers) president Shawn Fain has said that negotiators aren&#39;t close to reaching an agreement. This could test President Biden&#39;s commitment to making electric vehicles a source of well-paying union jobs. In Pennsylvania, police recently captured Danelo Cavalcante after he escaped county jail last month and was on the run for two weeks. Meanwhile, a judge has ruled that DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program is still illegal. In politics, previous Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has announced retirement, and Peter Daou, formerly a Democratic activist, is now running Cornel West&#39;s third-party campaign and views the two-party system as a bigger problem than Donald J Trump. In New Jersey, former governor Chris Christie and singer Bruce Springsteen have had a one-sided relationship due to their political differences but are now on good terms. Meanwhile, Republican nominee Vivek Ramaswamy has vowed to demolish much of the federal government should he get elected. On the international side of things, there was devastating flooding in Libya which killed thousands of people and left many missing. Scientists say this was due to climate change and geography coming together with disastrous results very quickly. Lastly, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un had a summit where they showcased their ties which signals a new era in their relationship amid speculation North Korea may be providing more weapons to Moscow for Ukraine&#39;s war.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
