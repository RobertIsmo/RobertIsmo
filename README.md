<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In the US, Memphis police officers have been charged with murder in connection with the death of Tyre Nichols. Cities across the country are bracing for protests after graphic video of the incident is released. Also in the US, Republicans are considering replacing their leader at the Republican National Committee after a string of losses in 2022 elections. Over in Ukraine, there&#39;s a corruption scandal raising concerns about US aid to the region. 

Meanwhile, in New York City, there&#39;s an ongoing battle to ban foie gras from restaurants. On the health front, experts are urging faster treatments for children with obesity and new guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics underscore how complicated childhood obesity is for patients and providers. Lastly, scuba divers sparked a &quot;bone rush&quot; after a podcast guest claimed that tons of prehistoric remains were dumped decades ago into East River.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
