<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there are some pretty major news events going on in US and world news. In the US, Mitt Romney has suggested that he will retire to make way for a &quot;new generation&quot; of leaders beyond President Biden and former President Trump. Additionally, reports have come out that Trump has been encouraging Republican lawmakers to impeach President Biden. On the economic front, inflation is on the rise and the Federal Reserve is taking notice.

In world news, military tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at an all-time high as Ukraine has fired missiles at Russia&#39;s Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. There have also been devastating floods in Libya, where more than 10,000 people are missing and over 5,000 have died. Morocco&#39;s mountains have also recently experienced a large earthquake that has put their tourist industry in doubt.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
