<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of political turmoil in the US right now, with former President Trump and his allies being accused of a crime and some of his supporters responding with violent rhetoric. Meanwhile, Ukraine is facing tension with Russia, including an explosion that has damaged critical infrastructure and affected many in the country. Elsewhere, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon was arrested in a financial inquiry and India had its worst railway disaster in decades. Lastly, debate is raging about the possibility of artificial intelligence becoming out of control, as well as potential racial implications of college admissions policies. Additionally, notorious domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski, known as the &quot;Unabomber&quot;, has passed away in prison.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
