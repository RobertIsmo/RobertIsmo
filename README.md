<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are currently a lot of political issues taking hold. In the U.S., President Biden is facing a test as Israeli forces push into southern Gaza and he&#39;s spoken out against a second term for Donald Trump. Legislation to send military aid to Ukraine and Israel is on the brink of collapse because of a disagreement on border restrictions. Republican leaders are also putting Harvard, M.I.T., and Penn on the defensive about anti-Semitism in congressional hearings. Meanwhile, Republican Senator Tuberville has dropped his blockade on most military promotions after pressure from senators in both parties. On top of that, true crime podcasts have become a big business with complicated implications for victims&#39; families, George Santos has been using Cameo videos to make an honest buck, and the Supreme Court is making decisions about a Trump-era tax provision.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
