<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on in the world lately! In the business world, the Writers Guild of America ended their 146-day strike with studios by reaching a deal they are satisfied with. And in the US, there is a little-known group called the States Project that is helping resurgent Democrats to wield power in politics. Also, Donald Trump is currently facing fraud trial prosecutions in New York, which has caused some worrying threats and concerns among his supporters. On the other hand, to help combat global warming, some scientists have been working on climate-defying fruits and vegetables that could change how we eat. In Finland, they&#39;re joining NATO after decades of going it alone in security issues. Also, Ukraine just received their first batch of Abrams tanks from the US ahead of schedule. Lastly, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez recently had bribery charges pressed against him this weekend and 13 gold bars were found in his home!</p>

<h3>Studios and Writers Reached a Deal. Here’s What Happens Next.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
