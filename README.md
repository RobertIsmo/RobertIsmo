<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of stories coming out of the US and abroad lately. In the US, a Texas judge has granted a woman&#39;s request to have an abortion, even though it&#39;s against the state laws. Meanwhile, in Israel and Gaza, there has been violence between the two sides and maps are being created to track the attacks. On the business front, an investigative piece in New York revealed that a famous hospital is charging poor patients for costly weight-loss surgery.

Also in the news are reports about Donald Trump&#39;s ongoing legal troubles, Nikki Haley&#39;s South Carolina strategy, and upcoming Republican debates hosted by CNN in Iowa and New Hampshire. Several college presidents have come under scrutiny for their reactions to student antisemitism, and over in Europe the German cultural scene is struggling with freedom of expression as they debate criticism of Israel. Lastly, there’s been some controversy around Artforum magazine, which fired its top editor over protests related to war-related boycotting.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
