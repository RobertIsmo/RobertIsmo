<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now in the world there is a lot of political activity. Ukrainian president Zelensky recently replaced the defense minister, saying it was necessary for new approaches. In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa has rebuked U.S. accusations that his country supplied arms to help fight Ukraine. The United Auto Workers and the big three Detroit automakers are in negotiations for a new contract, but a strike could take place if they cannot reach an agreement. Additionally, this summer has been filled with many labor strikes across the United States. In Minnesota, farmers have been using too much water to grow crops like corn and soybeans, leading to shortages. At Burning Man festival in Nevada last weekend, rain and mud held up the attendees and forced organizers to delay the burning of the manlike figure. At another event in Paris, swimming has become a full cultural experience for different people from all walks of life. In Los Angeles, a new city council map caused a huge political debate with allegations of racism surfacing in the process. Also, in Florida, there was an illegal redistricting ruling that targeted black voters and state legislators are now tasked with drawing a new map for 2024 elections. Finally, research has been done into the Native American boarding school system which forcibly removed Native children from their homes and families for more than a century in order to try and assimilate them.</p>

<h3>Zelensky Replaces Defense Minister, Citing Need for ‘New Approaches’</h3>
<sub>By Andrew E. Kramer</sub>
<p>The fate of the defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, had been the subject of increasing speculation in Ukraine. It was the biggest shake-up in Ukraine’s government since Russia’s full-scale invasion.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/48b3K9k"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>A government investigation about a Russian ship contradicts U.S. accusations that South Africa provided arms to fight Ukraine, President Cyril Ramaphosa said.

<h3>Big Farms and Flawless Fries Are Gulping Water in the Land of 10,000 Lakes</h3>

<h3>To Experience Paris Up Close and Personal, Plunge Into a Public Pool</h3>

<h3>How a New City Council Map of L.A. Turned Into a Political Brawl</h3>

<h3>‘War Against the Children’</h3>
<sub>By Zach Levitt, Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Simon Romero and Tim Wallace</sub>
<p>New research reveals the vast scope of the Native American boarding school system, which for more than a century removed Native children from their homes and families in an effort to assimilate them. Students at the schools gave up their names, their labor and sometimes their lives.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3qXvm0D"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
