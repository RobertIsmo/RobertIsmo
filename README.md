<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of important things happening around the world. In the US, the Treasury Department has announced that it will be taking accounting steps to avoid breaching its federal debt limit. US Republicans have also won important seats on an oversight committee, where they will be able to influence the country’s direction. At the same time, there is a lot of discussion about abortion rights and what comes next for pro-life activists as Roe V Wade turns 50. 

On a global level, New Zealand&#39;s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced that she will be stepping down soon. She became known worldwide for her efforts to handle the Covid pandemic in her country. 

Finally, with regards to domestic affairs in the US and especially New York, many businesses are suffering due to the “tripledemic” (financial recession + pandemic + holiday fatigue).  For example, bars and restaurants have been hit hard due to dry January and people cutting back on drinking.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
