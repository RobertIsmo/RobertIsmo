<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot going on in the world lately. Recently, a group of 13 Israeli hostages returned home after being taken by Hamas. Unfortunately, Gaza civilians are being killed at an unprecedented rate as a result of an Israeli barrage. On a more positive note, Derek Chauvin was convicted for murdering George Floyd and sentenced to over 20 years in prison, marking a rare rebuke of police misconduct. In other news, companies like Airbnb and Coca-Cola have pulled their ads from X due to Elon Musk promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories. In Europe, disabled women are still facing sterilization despite bans prohibiting the practice. To top it all off, there was a military-style drone attack in Kyiv, Ukraine this past Saturday. All in all, it&#39;s been quite a month for news!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
