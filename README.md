<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In the US, Republicans have launched an impeachment inquiry against President Biden as some far-right House Republicans are irate over spending and threatening to depose him. Also in the US, there is a looming scandal over four-time league MVP Aaron Rodgers&#39;s Jets season ending early with a torn Achilles&#39;s tendon after being carted off the field in the first regular season game. 

Internationally, Putin has spoken out about the cases against Donald Trump, describing it as showing the &#39;rottenness&#39; of the US system. The tragedy in Libya of a dam bursting and destroying an entire city just occurred as well, leaving more than 5,000 dead and submerging neighborhoods in Derna. Additionally, 30+ allied countries have been working on arming themselves against Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine, and satellite data has helped Morocco understand why their &#39;blind earthquake&#39; happened last week. 

Climate change is also having an effect as irreversible damage is being done to some of America&#39;s West glaciers that were once thought to be forever like Mount Rainier. Finally, Google has its monopoly trial this century with top tech executives showing up to litigate some major issues.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
