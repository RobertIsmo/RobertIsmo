<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some interesting things going on around the world. In the US, there are many consequences of the recent hurricanes, both in terms of storm surge and rip currents along the east coast, and the political effects in Washington DC. There&#39;s a lawsuit against Donald Trump for allegedly inflating his assets by 2.2 billion, and Republicans are debating whether or not Trump should even be allowed to run for president again. Meanwhile, Pope Francis is taking a stand against a strong US faction, and Ukraine is facing some serious aerial attacks both from itself and Russia. Lastly, Joe Biden is making drug price control a major policy focus while Medicaid systems have reportedly been reducing their rolls without verifying if it affects children.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
