<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, January 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
At the same time that we&#39;re seeing a decrease in homicides in many cities across the nation, we&#39;re also dealing with political turmoil. In the US, lawmakers have been unable to elect a Speaker for the House of Representatives after three days and numerous votes. The Republican Party is struggling with infighting between their more hard-right members and moderates. In addition, over in Russia, President Putin has proposed a cease-fire though Ukraine and other international adversaries doubt its legitimacy. Closer to home, NYC is experiencing a 22 percent increase in major crimes such as robberies and burglaries while gun violence fell last year. Finally, the Church is still dealing with divisions following Pope Benedict&#39;s funeral this week.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
