<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is getting ready to negotiate for lower prices on prescription drugs. America overuses its groundwater resources which needs to be addressed quickly before it impacts millions of people. We are also tracking Hurricane Idalia, which could be made stronger by hot sea temperatures this year. In China, their economy is slowing down and this has hurt many small business owners such as Sun Junli who lost everything due to a change in government policy. A Chinese influence campaign was taken down by Meta recently that spanned many accounts across various social media platforms. In regards to TikTok&#39;s future in the US, the US Secretary of Commerce will be in China this week to discuss its fate. There is a lot of unceasing conflict between Russia and Ukraine currently, especially in relation to merchant shipping on the Danube River that is becoming an increasingly important export artery for grain goods. This conflict is also affecting the soccer world, where sexism still exists between generations and was highlighted in Spain when a forced kiss happened between the president of the Spanish soccer federation and a famous player. On top of that, Trump&#39;s election lies have been damaging political relations and could leave the Michigan Republican Party broken if it isn&#39;t able to rebuild in time for the presidential election.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
