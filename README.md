<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It feels like there&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. Recently, the Jan. 6 committee released a flurry of documents about their investigation, and Representative Kevin McCarthy is struggling to become Speaker of the House. In Brazil, authorities are reviving a fraud case against George Santos from 2008. In Ukraine, there was a deadly strike on Russian nationals that was blamed on Moscow&#39;s military failings. An NFL game was postponed after a player collapsed on the field, and people are debating if an armed man with a gun in a supermarket caused panic illegally or not. On a lighter note, U.S. News &amp; World Report is changing its ranking system after law schools boycotted it, and we&#39;re learning about Juan Tamariz - the godfather of close-up card magic - and his art in Spain. Lastly, choreography on the ground has been helping meals reach the sky too! It&#39;s just an interesting mix of news all around!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
