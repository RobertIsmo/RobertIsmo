<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In the US, a 38-year-old entrepreneur is running for office and calling for policy changes to support millennials. In Iowa, a voter asked the Florida governor where he stands regarding former US President Trump. Also in the US, Bob Barker, a famous TV presenter and advocate for animal rights, passed away. 

In business news, there is discussion about how China&#39;s current economic troubles might affect the US. On an international note, FIFA suspended the president of the Spanish soccer federation over a post-game kiss. 
In Russia, there has been backlash against Yevgeny V. Prigozhin after reports of his death in a plane crash. Meanwhile in Ukraine, an orchestra played Beethoven&#39;s Ninth Symphony as sign of freedom while their top commander calls for more defenses in response to Russia&#39;s possible territorial expansions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
