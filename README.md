<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s government is proposing a major overhaul of the judiciary system, but it has been met with criticism from opponents who say it goes too far. There have also been increased tensions resulting in protests and clashes with police. 

In Ukraine, news is not much better as there are plans to rebuild a colossal cargo plane which was destroyed last year in the battle for its airfield, despite other pressing needs in the region.

In the tech world, Twitter is dealing with a source code leak while start-up funding has cooled after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Meanwhile, gun violence continues to be an issue across the US and more people are being affected as a result. 

Vice President Kamala Harris is currently on a tour through Africa to help deepen relations amid China&#39;s influence. In the US, House Democrats nominated Representative Hakeem Jeffries as their leader who is trained by Manhattan’s legal elite and raised in Black Brooklyn.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
