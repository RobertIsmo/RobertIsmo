<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks to be a chaotic time in the world right now. Police departments are struggling with staffing shortages due to pandemic-related repercussions and others are offering bonuses to luring recruits. On Christmas Eve, there was a bus crash in Canada that resulted in four deaths and dozens of injuries. A South Korean tour group got stranded near Buffalo after a huge blizzard. In Ukraine, citizens are fighting back against Russian forces by spying on them and actively undermining their operations. Additionally, in Memphis, high schools are implementing specialized literacy programs to support students in academics other than English. The British monarchy has been embracing a more inclusive approach with King Charles III, while in Britain there&#39;s a bridge that is constantly being bashed into by vehicles.

Looking on the brighter side, 2021 has seen an incredible rise in the intersection between sports and fashion, while there have also been some amazing TV offerings like ‘Barry’ and ‘This Fool’. If you’re looking for easier dessert recipes for this holiday season, you won&#39;t be disappointed as there are many no-fuss items to choose from. We&#39;ve also been seeing families gifting air fryers so if you were lucky enough to receive one then there are plenty of great recipes out there for you to try too!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
