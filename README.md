<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few major stories happening in the world right now. In Israel, their Supreme Court recently issued a landmark ruling that broke with previous precedent. In South Korea, an opposition leader was attacked and has since been arrested on corruption charges. Russia is under fire for bombing Ukraine following a deadly attack in one of its cities. Further, there was an earthquake in Japan that caused buildings to collapse trapping some people underneath. Finally, the U.S. is debating whether former President Trump should be granted &quot;absolute immunity&quot; following his second impeachment trial.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
