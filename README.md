<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there have been several news stories related to issues around the world. In Hawaii, survivors of a missing persons list were discovered despite bureaucracy standing in the way. Additionally, there are Native Hawaiians seeking spiritual revival and connecting with traditional culture. In China, a crisis of confidence has taken hold in the economy, causing despair among citizens. U.S retailers are noticing shifts in consumer spending habits as well. Meanwhile, Silicon Valley elites are attempting to buy and build their own city from scratch in the San Francisco Bay Area. There was also an interesting story of a G.O.P presidential debate where candidates looked to cash in, while Senator Tim Scott faded into the background and an unverifiable anecdote from Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida made headlines. We also have news about a singer from North of Richmond whose No. 1 Billboard hit has Republicans claiming it as an anthem despite his wishes, and reports of drone strikes being used by Ukraine against Russia in a message to their own people.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
