<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the US is trying to finalize a debt limit deal, and the debate is getting heated among politicians. Climate activists are unhappy with a provision in the deal related to permits for a controversial oil pipeline. In Russia, drones were sent near Moscow to bring attention to the war in Ukraine. A court recently ruled that the owners of Purdue Pharma can be shielded from opioid liability, potentially leaving billions of dollars for states and communities affected by addiction. Summer Books 2023 has put out its list of 47 new reads. Scientists are studying how dirty gas stoves in New York apartments are, while in Iowa, residents are protesting against a plan to quickly demolish a collapsed building. People in Berkeley, California are debating the building of apartments in backyards. North Korea attempted to launch a spy satellite over South Korea, and Elizabeth Holmes began serving an 11-year jail sentence after being convicted of fraud for starting Theranos. Finally, even after it was debunked decades ago, Sybil&#39;s true story continues to hold people&#39;s interest.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
