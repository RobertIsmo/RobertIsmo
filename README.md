<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a devastating earthquake in Morocco, and rescuers are having trouble getting to the hardest-hit areas quickly. Countries are still clashing around the situation in Ukraine, despite an agreement not to criticize Russia at the G20 Summit. Vietnam is pursuing a secret arms deal with Russia, even as it strengthens ties with the US. At the U.S. Open, 19 year old Coco Gauff and Novak Djokovic won their respective singles titles. There have been reports of torture in Ukraine by Russia, and one particular US arms dealer who has gotten millions in Pentagon funds has been making a lot of money. In Paris, they are trying to create &quot;cool green spaces&quot; by repurposing old railroads to survive climate change. Here in NYC, Mayor Adams is calling for budget cuts after seeing increased costs related to migrants, while employers are eager to hire them despite some tension. Finally, Walter Isaacson&#39;s biography of Elon Musk was just released, which depicts him as a mercurial man-child with grand ambitions and ambitions that sometimes don&#39;t align with reality.</p>

<h3>In Search of Cool Green Spaces, Paris Turns to an Old Rail Line</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
