<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is in an interesting state right now. In the US, there are legal battles about classified evidence and the Justice Department is sending out target letters as part of its investigations into certain individuals. In Canada, wildfires have burned 25 million acres this year due to record warm temperatures. On the global front, Europe has been hit hard by a recent heat wave – a divide has emerged with low-income workers being the most vulnerable. Even worse, the Middle East saw life-threatening temperature indices of 152 degrees recently. In politics, North Korea has detained a US soldier for unauthorized border crossing; tensions between the White House and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel have arisen; and protests against legal overhauls have flared in Israel. On a lighter note, one magazine writer is attempting to track down Tom Cruise! Closer to home, a wife was questioned in connection with her husband&#39;s murder at Gilgo Beach, NY.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
