<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, Palestinian militants launched an attack which has been described as the most complex assault on their territory in half a century. In Russia, its economy has become increasingly structured around its war in Ukraine despite punishing sanctions. We are also seeing increasing numbers of grizzly bears in parts of Western U.S. and Canada, which have given rise to new strategies on how to deal with them. Meanwhile, Nobel Prizes were awarded this year to Claudia Goldin for her research into gender gaps in labor force participation and earnings, and to researchers studying climate change and food production.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
