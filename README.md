<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some troubling developments lately in the world. In the U.S., Republicans have started to launch investigations against the newly elected Biden administration and a Republican congressman-elect has been accused of exaggerating his resume. On top of that, a number of flight delays caused chaos and frustration for airline passengers in recent weeks. Globally, people are still struggling to cope with indoor air pollution from gas stoves and plastic continues to be a huge environmental issue. Additionally, Christian Nationalism is on the rise in Montana.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
