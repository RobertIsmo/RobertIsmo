<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of major current events taking place around the world. The United States and China are in a fierce competition to develop military technology for the unregulated high-altitude zone of &quot;near space&quot;, and the Republican Party has backed away from calls to overhaul U.S. entitlement programs. Further, suspicions are arising in Germany over ties between the director of their spy service and Russia. In addition, Luxembourg is facing hardships supplying Ukraine with the weapons necessary for defense, while stock investors have become jittery due to a strong economy. The Federal Reserve&#39;s resolve may soon cause a shakeup in financial markets, while China is decreasing its incentive for entrepreneurs to invest long term as an artificial intelligence watermarking system is being developed. Meanwhile, Canada is debating sexism and ageism after veteran news anchor Lisa LaFlamme was laid off due to her refusal to dye her hair gray. Lastly, five Memphis police officers face charges of second-degree murder in the beating death of Tyre Nichols, and there is an uproar amongst progressive voices in New York City after they were asked to sign a statement of principles.</p>

<h3>Why China Didn’t Invent ChatGPT</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
