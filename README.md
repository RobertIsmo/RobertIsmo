<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
1. Right-Wing Trump Allies have won seats on the US House&#39;s main investigative committee, which reflects the priorities of the Republican party. 
 
2. The US is warming to helping Ukraine target Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. 
 
3. At the World Economic Forum, European leaders are calling for unity while also celebrating the safety of their energy supply for the winter. 
4. A helicopter crash in Kyiv killed Ukraine&#39;s Interior Minister, a top adviser to President Zelensky, as well as at least 14 other people. 
 
5. Microsoft is planning to lay off 10,000 workers in an effort to cut costs.
6. In New York, a Senate panel rejected Governor Hochul&#39;s nomination of Justice LaSalle to become the state’s top judge. The battle is rooted in both judicial policy and politics, as progressive Democrats try to claim power. 
7. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced that she will be stepping down on Feb 7th. 
8. The Israeli Supreme Court has ordered Netanyahu&#39;s minister be removed, as the government attempts to restrict court powers over a fight concerning the judiciary system. 
9. Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX and Alameda has been accused of gaming markets and crypto coin prices in order to benefit his companies.
10. Intuitive eating, once considered radical, was popularized by Elyse Resch and Evelyn Tribole 30 years ago and it is now the cornerstone of modern anti-diet movements around the world.
11. George Santos used fashion to flout societal rules and gain attention for himself as a con man.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
