<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the US right now. The House of Representatives is in chaos after a vote to remove the speaker, and there is no sense of who might lead it. On top of that, Matt Gaetz, a polarizing figure in Congress, is quickly becoming polarizing at home too. And as if that weren&#39;t enough, Florida Governor DeSantis&#39; campaign was in financial dire straits this summer but he recently got a $15 million cash infusion and moved his campaign staff to Iowa. Meanwhile, there&#39;s also an ongoing investigation into former New York City Mayor Giuliani&#39;s drinking, and two lawyers are facing trial this month as part of a state racketeering case against Donald Trump over 2020 election interference. In New York City, they&#39;re trying to suspend the right-to-shelter mandate regarding migrants, while recently arrived migrants are turning to street vending with turf battles with more established vendors becoming common. Lastly, in Mongolia there&#39;s an 8-year-old boy who may have to defend Tibetan Buddhism from pressure from China&#39;s ruling Communist Party.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
