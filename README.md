<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey there! There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, President Zelensky is trying to prevent support for the war from becoming a partisan issue. In Russia, President Putin is acknowledging military failings and insisting that they will fight on. Meanwhile here in the U.S., we have just released documents that show President Donald Trump paid only $1.1 million in federal income taxes during his first three years as president and paid no taxes in 2020. It&#39;s also looking like there might be a dangerous winter storm heading our way later this week - lots of snow, strong winds, and potentially life-threatening temperatures. Finally, lawmakers are steering more than $15 billion in pet projects back home and the Jan 6 attacks are being looked into again, with witnesses saying they plead the fifth - which can make it hard for authorities to investigate what happened.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
