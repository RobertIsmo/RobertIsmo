<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, July 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In Ukraine, soldiers are joining the fight to reclaim towns occupied by the Russian military. Meanwhile, South Africa recently announced that Russian president Putin will not be attending an upcoming diplomatic summit. In the US, former president Trump may face obstruction and fraud charges following a target letter from the Dept. of Justice. Also in the US, Michigan has charged 16 people for attempting to overturn Trump&#39;s 2020 election loss and Florida is experiencing record hot temperatures from a relentless early-summer heat wave. In Spain, they&#39;re turning to medieval solutions to address draught caused by climate change and hip-hop has celebrated its 50th anniversary while facing abuse allegations against Mississippi sheriff Eddie Scott. Lastly, authorities in New York have charged a man with murder for 11 bodies found near Gilgo Beach and are investigating if more may be connected to him.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
