<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things are a bit chaotic around the world. Former President Donald Trump recently surrendered at a jail in Georgia to face criminal cases in connection with election interference. At the same time, an infamous Russian businessman has been put on blast for challenging President Vladimir Putin, making it clear that anyone who goes against Putin will face dire consequences. In addition, Republicans had their first debate for the coming election year, and Democrats are struggling to address the crisis of wildfires destructing Greece this summer. Closer to home here in the US, Hawaiian Electric is getting blamed for allowing a deadly fire to start in Maui, and Connecticut is considering reinstating a law that allows residents to kill bears under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
