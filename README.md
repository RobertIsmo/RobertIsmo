<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a lot of news about the Middle East recently. An airstrike in Gaza by Israel killed a Hamas leader, but also many other people according to Hamas. It comes as Palestine is facing fuel, food, and water shortages and pushing civilians to their breaking point. In Europe, the situation has caused an outbreak of antisemitism which has similarly raised the level of threats against Americans and Muslims here in the US. 

We&#39;ve also seen major changes to gun laws being discussed in Maine after a mass shooting there. Elsewhere there&#39;s a summit happening in the UK involving 27 nations coming together to discuss how to regulate artificial intelligence. Vice President Harris has announced steps to curb any risks AI could present too. 

In other news, a panel has said that an innovative sickle cell treatment is safe for patients and might be approved by the FDA soon. There was also a jury decision awarding $1.8 billion to home sellers against various brokerages. More good news for workers came this week as the UAW managed to get some striking gains that experts say could set precedents for other labor advances in bargaining contracts and organizing workers.

Finally, we got some more insight into Britney Spears&#39; memoir that was released this week and details some of the many people involved in getting her life story on the page! And we&#39;ve also seen several op-ed questions provoking us to think about whether lies about past wars in the Middle East are getting in the way of knowing what&#39;s really happening today.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
