<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some pretty big developments happening around the world lately! In the US, there is a lot of discussion surrounding Donald Trump&#39;s impeachment, with a House panel officially accusing him of insurrection and referring him to the Justice Department. Meanwhile, there is also a case against Harvey Weinstein in Los Angeles resulting in a guilty verdict for rape. On the political side of things, George Santos was recently elected to the House in New York, but has been accused of misrepresenting himself in his résumé. 

In other news, Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Belarus recently, raising concerns about a possible Russian offensive against Ukraine. At home, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey built an $82 million wall along the US-Mexico border, only for his successor Katie Hobbs calling it a waste of money. Finally, Elon Musk briefly surveyed Twitter users to see if he should remain as boss of his company, but kept silent after respondents said he should quit.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
