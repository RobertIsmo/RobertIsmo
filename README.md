<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot has been going on lately in the world. For starters, another former president, Donald Trump, had the chance to join a G.O.P. debate but chose to skip it instead and came up with his own plans for counterprogramming. Polls show that Democrats and Republicans broadly agree that things are not going well in the nation. Meanwhile, Rudolph Giuliani is facing financial trouble and Trump is unfortunately doing little to help him out. Elsewhere in the world, Hurricane Hilary is moving through the Pacific Ocean and putting Los Angeles under a tropical storm warning, while people in the South are dealing with unusually hot and humid weather. Additionally, countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United States have reached a defense agreement which China sees as encirclement or provocation. In Brazil, two members of an isolated tribe recently emerged after years of being cut off from society and now pose a tricky challenge for Brazil’s government officials. To make matters even worse, some jails in Wisconsin have been locked down for months due to dire staffing shortages which is leading to more lockdowns across the country.</p>

<h3>The South Knows a Hot, Sticky Summer. But This? ‘It’s Hell.’</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
