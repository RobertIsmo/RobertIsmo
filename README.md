<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of news about business, politics, and social issues in the U.S. Fox is dealing with an internal crisis following the release of offensive messages sent by one of their hosts. The House Republicans just passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling while cutting federal spending, but President Biden has vowed to veto it. A woman who accused Donald Trump of rape gave her testimony in court and Disney is suing Florida over their control of its resort. People are questioning Twitter&#39;s verification system after they removed the check marks used to authenticate accounts. In India, a new cricket league is offering opportunities for young women that never existed before, and in California there are discussions to repeal a ban on state-funded travel to certain conservative states. Lastly, First Republic Bank is struggling financially due to losses and lack of loan payments from homeowners and businesses.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
