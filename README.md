<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news recently about elections, politics, and the economy. In Ohio, voters rejected an amendment intended to limit access to abortion. This reflects an effort by Republicans to try and curb voting rights. Meanwhile, in the US Presidential election there is still tension between Biden and Trump over the results. 

On the economic front, in China prices are decreasing leading to worries of deflation. To combat this, Biden&#39;s government is trying to limit investments from China due to national security threats. One investment giant, Country Gardens, is facing default which could have a big impact on China&#39;s economy. 

Finally, stolen art and cultural items are starting to be returned home from foreign museums; however many countries with artifacts looted by western nations in the past don&#39;t have the resources to prepare for making claims. In Romania there was an attack by Russian drones very close to NATO territory which has had both physical and psychological effects on those living nearby.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
