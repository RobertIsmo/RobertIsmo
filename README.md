<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some major international news stories recently. In Hungary, Ukraine aid is being blocked as talks on European Union membership officially open, while in the US factions of both sides of the political spectrum are demanding action to help Ukraine. The US are also trying to intervene in the escalating conflict between Israel and Gaza, calling for a more targeted phase in the war. Closer to home, a debate on campus free speech has arisen following the fall of a university president, while Republicans have rejected funding for another college&#39;s veterinary school. Internationally, Brazil have approved a law weakening protection of its indigenous lands despite pushback from their former president,  Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. There have also been some opinion pieces about U.S. Supreme Court justices stopping Trump&#39;s legal delay game, life with long Covid, the biggest threat to America&#39;s universities and Liz Cheney&#39;s recent book.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
