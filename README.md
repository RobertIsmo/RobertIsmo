<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Many American Jewish leaders are criticizing a plan in Israel to reduce judicial power, and the US Justice Department found significant discriminatory policing in Louisville. As tensions in Georgia between Russia and the West increase, Fox News host Tucker Carlson is facing scrutiny after it was revealed that he personally dislikes President Trump despite praising him publicly. The Pentagon is not sharing evidence of potential Russian war crimes with the International Criminal Court, and a bill has passed through the US Senate to block a crime law in Washington DC, even though President Biden initially opposed it. In Mexico, people are questioning the government’s response to an attack on four Americans, two of which were killed during a kidnapping. This brings attention to medical tourism industry risks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
