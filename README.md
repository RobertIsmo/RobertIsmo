<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, August 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is an incredibly active hurricane season in the US and the Caribbean, which has been worrying people and creating havoc with weather forecasts. Meanwhile, in Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is gaining attention for his Ivy League-backed political plays. Sports fans are celebrating Spain&#39;s recent World Cup win, but are also reflecting on sexism and gender bias in sports. In Russia, a lunar lander has crashed into the moon, while in Ukraine soldiers on the front line say they are better off now than they were a few months ago. Finally, beekeepers around the world are working to improve conservation efforts of honeybees.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
