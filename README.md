<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, September 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, people are using cluster munitions to fight Russian forces, despite concerns over human rights. In the U.S., abortions have increased in most states this year, due to people crossing state lines for care. Covid keeps rising worldwide, and experts are still trying to understand the short- and long-term risks of having more than one infection. Meanwhile, N.F.L. running backs are being devalued, and China’s exports and imports have been dropping steadily for several months. Finally, there’s an escaped murderer in Pennsylvania whom the police are still searching for.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
