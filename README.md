<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it seems like a lot of high-powered individuals are making news headlines. In the US, we have Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida, who is expanding his power in office and suggesting he&#39;ll do so if elected President. In entertainment news, Tina Turner has sadly passed away at 83 after inspiring many with her dynamic performances and echoing her personal struggles in her songs. Meanwhile, Ukrainians are suspected of a drone attack in Russia and there have been reports of Chinese malware targeting Guam; but some suggest Taiwan may be the true target. And in Texas, there&#39;s a battle between GOP leaders Attorney General Ken Paxton and House speaker over corruption and drunkenness allegations. Finally, we have millionaires vs billionaires as Federico Pignatelli and Ray Dalio fight over control of a historic building in SoHo, New York.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
