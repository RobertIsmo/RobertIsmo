<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of worrying news reports happening around the world. In the US, for example, we are seeing issues with the emergency alert system as a wildfire in Maui demonstrated recently. We also have reports of different weapons being sent to Ukraine, which prompts the story of three people whose lives have been forever changed by these weapons. There is also a lot of tension concerning Russia attacking Ukrainian river ports and Ukraine&#39;s president announcing that two more ships had traveled through a temporary corridor after Moscow pulled out of the Black Sea grain deal. 

In other parts of the world, China is asking all citizens to help guard against foreign enemies, making it difficult to figure out if it&#39;s actually vigilance or just paranoia. And in terms of environmental news, we know that unchecked overuse of groundwater is draining and damaging aquifers across America as well as Minnesota farmers cranking up powerful wells and blowing through state limits in order to grow certain types of crops. Last but not least, over in Ukraine there is still damage from a dam disaster months after it happened with many communities still reeling.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
