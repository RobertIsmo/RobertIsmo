<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

Well, it looks like Fed Rate increases could mean higher costs for borrowing on credit cards, student loans and other forms of debt in the US. In Russia, they&#39;re constructing a defence network to slow down Ukraine&#39;s progress. On a different note, an American citizen was arrested in Russia on spying charges that some say are unfounded. Russians arms dealer Viktor Bout has left a dark legacy throughout Africa due to his distribution of weapons during the 1990s and early 2000s.
In China, Covid-19 stats have become more opaque as restrictions have been relaxed. A group of right-wingers in the US are seemingly unphased by former President Trump&#39;s lobbying efforts to get Kevin McCarthy elected Speaker of the House. Senator Kyrsten Sinema is another lawmaker who switched party lines in 2021; her future is unclear at this point. 
Morocco and France are currently set up for a World Cup match with some underlying colonial tensions at play. Grant Wahl passed away from a burst blood vessel in his heart and it&#39;s been quite a year for New York City&#39;s restaurant scene with Pete Wells providing his own top 10 list of new eateries. Lastly, a Maryland couple fought against their Homeowner Association when they were asked to replace their wildlife-friendly plants with turf grass - they ended up changing state law!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
