<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of unrest in the world. In Ukraine, their military was successful against Russia but they had to retreat from a major city. In Russia, opposition leader Alexei Navalny was moved to an Arctic prison and his allies are worried about him. In the US, we&#39;ve had a record-breaking winter season with unusually warm temperatures and no snow, which some people think could mean that climate change is accelerating. There was also a huge blizzard that caused disruptions across northern and central parts of the US. Meanwhile, some parents are trying to pressure the GOP for gun control after a school shooting. And there&#39;s a proposed natural gas project on the coast of Louisiana that President Biden is facing critical decisions on. Lastly, in Israel there has been a devastating raid and kidnap by Hamas which is causing deep trauma and could shape the country for years to come. In Gaza too, there&#39;s fighting intensifying with nearly two million people pouring into areas without access to shelter or security. And in regards to the US again, there&#39;s an increase in medical errors at hospitals owned by private equity firms and homeless people are taking over downtown Phoenix despite efforts to help them. It&#39;s been quite a year!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
