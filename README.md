<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Brazil, the largest isolated tribe in the Amazon is dying due to illegal mines that are devastating their communities. In Ecuador, international support has failed to protect the Amazon rainforest from drilling, and now the government wants to expand it even more. In Mississippi, a deadly tornado ripped through a rural area, killing and injuring dozens of people. Also in Mississippi, an art installation of &#39;Teddy’s Bear&#39; sculptures was damaged in a storm more than a century after an important hunting trip by Theodore Roosevelt. On the Ukrainian front, unqualified American volunteers are accessing American weapons and bickering among each other. In Israel, their defense minister is criticizing a plan that would weaken their judiciary - this due to weeks of unrest and concerns over military capacity. UConn&#39;s streak of Final Fours since 2008 ended in a loss to Ohio State. In Texas, former US president Donald Trump spoke at his first big rally since leaving office - addressing issues related to his own legal peril. There&#39;s also been some political skulduggery involving October surprises, like Stormy Daniels who&#39;s been charged by a Manhattan grand jury. And finally, Japan isn&#39;t taking advantage of geothermal power resources due to pressure from powerful local interests who are concerned about preserving centuries-old traditions.</p>

<h3>Israel’s Defense Minister Says Government Should Halt Contentious Judicial Plan</h3>

<h3>UConn’s Streak of Final Fours Ends in Loss to Ohio State</h3>

<h3>Trump Puts His Legal Peril at Center of First Big Rally for 2024</h3>

<p>Facing a potential indictment, the former president devoted much of his speech in Waco, Texas, to criticizing the justice system, though his attacks were less personal and caustic than in recent days.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3LMv3xU"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
