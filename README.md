<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of political developments happening around the world. Benjamin Netanyahu is carrying out an all-out war in Israel, while Joe Biden is facing risks with a wartime visit to the country. Hamas has been hijacking victims&#39; social media accounts to spread terror, and in the US, the House is still without a Speaker. On the international front, Vladimir Putin has visited China to bolster ties with Xi Jinping, China has been investing $1 trillion for global influence, and Ukraine has been using powerful new missiles. Lastly, Poland could soon be led by a different governing party, which could lead to significant shifts in laws and policies.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
