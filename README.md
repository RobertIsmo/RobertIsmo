<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Republican lawmakers are moving ahead with Gov. Ron DeSantis&#39;s wish list of legislation, including expanding gun rights. Meanwhile, conservative state legislators are pushing for more oversight of prosecutors they think are too liberal. Internationally, South Korea has filled the gap in exports of arms that the US is unable to meet due to wartime production shortages; Russian troops and mercenaries are locked in a fierce battle for control of a city in Ukraine; and Chinese President Xi Jinping is fixing his sights on growth and power as the country&#39;s economy is expected to grow by 5%. Back home, Marines are being trained to prepare for potential battles with China, while movie theaters and employers alike find themselves using personality tests to better understand their customers&#39; behaviors.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
