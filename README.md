<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the world is in a state of flux right now. In the US, there&#39;s a push for universities to use &quot;Adversity Scores&quot; to build a more diverse student body, which is prompting a renewed conversation around affirmative action. There&#39;s also been a Supreme Court ruling that has caused a lot of people to think about the legacy of slavery. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Russian forces have launched drone attacks and military counteroffensives against the capital city Kyiv. Across Europe, two Russians and a Ukrainian have been arrested for allegedly being spies while exploring an abandoned armory. In Los Angeles, hotel workers are going on strike due to high living costs and across America there are conflicted feelings about celebrating the Fourth of July. Everyone is awaiting news from an exploratory expedition to the Titanic wreckage, which was last heard when they sent a series of text messages. Also, Artificial Intelligence technology is becoming increasingly complex and advanced so much so that it&#39;s even invading mathematics now - people are both excited and scared about what this means for the future. Finally, chatbots are being developed that don&#39;t have many boundaries and constraints which could open up new possibilities - and potential risks.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
