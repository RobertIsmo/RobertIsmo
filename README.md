<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been an eventful few weeks in the world! In the US, there have been some troubling cases of children being used for labor and the government being warned about the risk of doing so. An 84 year old was even charged with shooting a black teenager who went to the wrong house. A man has also been charged with a woman&#39;s murder who ended up at his house by mistake in upstate New York. There was also the case of Jayland Walker, a 25 year old Black man who was shot dozens of times after an attempted traffic stop and chase in Akron, Ohio. 

Elsewhere, China has started recovering from its economic halt due to Covid-19. It seems like a fierce &quot;price war&quot; over electric cars has erupted in China too. There have also been debates about Crumbl Cookies being the best or worst but that doesn&#39;t seem to matter as it helps their business. On the political tip, McCarthy has proposed a one-year debt ceiling increase tied to spending cuts, and Republicans are attacking Bragg in New York for recent crimes happening in his district. Lastly, Robert F Kennedy Jr is soon gonna announce his white house run but he has been sowing doubts about vaccinations by twisting facts out of context which isn&#39;t helping anyone. Lastly, there was a tragic story about Latavia McGee who met gunshot and violent kidnap after going to Mexico for a tummy tuck – leaving two of her friends dead. 2 fourth graders were also left wounded after a gunman opened fire in their classroom in Texas last year and they still try to see the light of day.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
