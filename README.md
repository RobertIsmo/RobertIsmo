<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some alarming diplomatic developments in the US recently - a Chinese spy balloon was spotted earlier this week and was brought down when an F-22 fighter jet fired an air-to-air missile at it off the coast of South Carolina. Meanwhile, temperatures across New York and New England have been incredibly cold, with some record lows being reached. On the political side, Democrats plan to overhaul their presidential primaries and put more racially diverse states at the front of the line, while Europe is seemingly reluctant to build its own defense against Russia&#39;s recent invasions.

In more positive news, Lhakpa Sherpa has climbed Mount Everest 10 times - the most ascents ever by a woman - while working at Whole Foods! LeBron James is also in the headlines, as he tries to break Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#39;s career scoring record with the Lakers. Plus, to tackle homelessness in America, sheriffs, social workers and volunteers are working hard during 10 days in January to count homeless people across the country. Finally, if you&#39;re looking for something fun to do over the weekend, you may want to check out what&#39;s happening in Bangkok or learn about how Barnes &amp; Noble recovered from near death!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
