<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
This list of news articles provides a glimpse into what is happening in the world right now. There are issues related to politics, business, science, and technology. For example, leaders at the Group of 7 summit are celebrating their success in stabilizing global oil markets and the Supreme Court has sidestepped ruling on scope of internet liability shield. On the other hand there are tensions between Ukraine and Russia in which intelligence technologies are playing an important role. China is also playing a major role on the geopolitical stage by hosting its own summit in Central Asia. 

In the US, Senator Dianne Feinstein—89-year-old California Democrat—has been dealing with serious health complications lately and the Supreme Court has ruled against Andy Warhol in a copyright case. And back home, New York City is facing an escalating crisis due to migrants crossing the border for which Mayor Bill de Blasio pleaded understanding from its citizens.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
