<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there are a lot of different things happening around the world. In the US, there is an upcoming policy change that could lead to a surge of migration at the southern border; President Biden has ordered 1,500 active-duty troops to the border as a precaution. In Ukraine, they are bracing for a possible counteroffensive, and residents have been returning to their homes after years of war. There was also a mass shooting in Texas recently that left at least nine people dead. Globally, there was recently a coronation ceremony for a new king where old customs were revived. And in New York, Donald Trump is facing tax fraud charges that rarely get used against ex-presidents.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
