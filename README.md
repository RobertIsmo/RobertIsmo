<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To a close friend, I would say that there has been a lot of tension between Ukraine and Russia over their current political and military states. In response to Ukraine&#39;s long-anticipated counteroffensive, the US is attempting to bring diplomatic resolution to the issue. Immigration also has been in the news, as pandemic-era restrictions have been lifted at the border. This unfortunately has caused a lot of delays and backlogs in immigration courts. Additionally there&#39;s been some violence in NY, with a man charged with manslaughter for killing another on the subway. Lastly, Turkey is having an election that could mean a new shift in power for their president. On a lighter note, 25 years later a classic sitcom about nothing is incredibly relevant, and we have a new nonhormonal drug to help with menopause hot flashes.</p>

<h3>Ukraine’s Offensive Could Set Stage for Diplomacy With Russia, U.S. Officials Say</h3>

<h3>Turkey’s President Amassed Power. He Could Still Lose This Election.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
