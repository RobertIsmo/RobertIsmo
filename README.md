<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, a lot of big things are happening around the world. For starters, in the US, the government is quickly approaching its borrowing limit and that has investors concerned about what this could mean for the economy. There&#39;s also a Supreme Court case with potentially major implications for online speech that&#39;s set to come down soon. In politics, allies of former President Trump have recently been appointed to key oversight positions in the House of Representatives, reflecting Republican priorities. Turning over seas to New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is stepping down after facing some domestic headwinds but global praise for her leadership throughout the pandemic. She will be remembered for her charisma and frank, compassionate approach. In another global event, there was a helicopter crash in Kyiv that killed at least 14 people—including a top adviser and interior minister]—as Ukraine&#39;s war hit a critical phase. Closer to home, Covid restrictions have made life difficult for bar owners and many people have taken up ‘Dry January’ as an annual challenge but there may be more benefits to trying it than just abstaining from drinking—even small amounts of alcohol can have serious health consequences according to new Canadian guidelines.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
