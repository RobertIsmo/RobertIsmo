<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In Israel, there are allegations of friendly-fire killings of hostages, and the government is having to reconsider its Gaza strategy. There&#39;s also controversy over Jeff Roe, a top strategist for Florida governor Ron DeSantis&#39; presidential campaign, stepping down. Meanwhile in the U.S., Muslims students at Harvard are facing racism and alienation, and former President Trump is attributing his felony charges to “politically motivated persecution”. Elsewhere, India has apps for literal dream babies and New Zealand is debating a rightward shift with regards to their pro-Maori policies; and we&#39;ve got economists discussing financial safeguards given climate change isn&#39;t on the agenda anymore. On top of all this, Disney is celebrating its 100th anniversary, and people are wondering if it still has the same monopoly on culture that it used to have.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
