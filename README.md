<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Joe Biden is running for office again and Black voters are expressing their frustration with him. Meanwhile, Democrats in South Carolina have elected their first Black woman to run their state party.

In Ukraine, fighting is settling into a bloody stalemate in the eastern Donbas region. At the same time, there&#39;s a large fire burning at the Crimea fuel depot due to a suspected drone attack by an unknown source. 

On a more positive note, there&#39;s an inspiring story about Artem Moroz who lost his legs in the war but hasn&#39;t lost hope or his will to run for it gave him a new goal. 

In terms of economic news, US regulators are preparing to seize and sell First Republic bank due to trouble within the lender. 

On the sports side of things, the NFL draft just finished up and we can look forward to some new teams developing already with the picks they made.

Finally, there is another interesting story out of Korea where the &#39;Lord Commander&#39; of the DMZ has faced off with North Korean troops and played an important part in preparing for the Trump-Kim summit.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
