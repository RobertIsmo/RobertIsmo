<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, business is a bit rough in the US. Manufacturing is dropping off even as new production balls get rolling, and the banking crisis isn&#39;t over in the eyes of Wall Street investors. Carlson sent a text that caused uproar in Fox and led to his firing. In Texas, a man was arrested for allegedly killing five people and there&#39;s lots of debate about gun control in the state. There’s also an escalating debt limit debate on the federal level, with pundits citing the 14th Amendment. A court also rejected a Montana lawmaker’s effort to return to office after her comments about transgender legislation. Meantime, a Trump trial is going on where Carroll is being cross-examined about her account of how she reacted after an attack from Trump which she has accused him of. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court recently released details on a landmark abortion case from Justice John Paul Stevens’ files which have since been made public. Finally, writers have gone on strike due to various issues and this has affected late show production – not sure how long it will last but during the last strike they gradually returned after a couple of months.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
