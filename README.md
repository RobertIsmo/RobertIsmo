<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things are a bit hectic in the news lately. In the US, President Zelensky gave a speech to Congress about how American aid is an investment in global security and democracy, potentially because of the looming war with Russia. We&#39;ve also got some crazy weather about to cross over the country; it&#39;s expected to bring heavy snow and cold temperatures. On the political front, Donald Trump hasn&#39;t been audited by the IRS during his first two years as president, which raises flags of potential politicization. On top of all that, there&#39;s this &quot;Tripledemic&quot; happening where RSV has likely peaked but flu and COVID-19 cases are still increasing. On the other side of the world, Chinese censors aren&#39;t sure what to do since their official propaganda is being thrown off by the end of &quot;zero Covid&quot;. Finally, doctors have accused NYU&#39;s ER of prioritizing donors, trustees, and their families over other patients. It&#39;s wild right now!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
