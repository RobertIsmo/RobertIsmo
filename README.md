<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are several major events happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, Russian warplanes have been dropping Soviet-era bombs that are almost impossible to shoot down. In Turkey, President Erdogan has been using monuments and TV shows to rally his voters and censor or jail cultural opponents who disagree with him. Also, the Supreme Court has limited the Environmental Protection Agency&#39;s power to address water pollution. In the US, Ron DeSantis has announced a presidential bid and Casey DeSantis is preparing to join him on the campaign trail. Microsoft president Brad Smith is calling for rules to minimize risks associated with artificial intelligence. And lastly, Tina Turner’s life and legacy was commemorated through photos following her passing.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
