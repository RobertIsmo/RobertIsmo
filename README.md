<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the economy is really uncertain and there are fears that we may be headed towards a recession. The banking sector has been particularly affected and lenders like First Republic have had to get bailouts from larger banks in order to stay afloat. In other news, Turkish President Erdogan just endorsed Finland&#39;s bid for NATO, but he&#39;s continuing to refuse to recognize Sweden, claiming they&#39;re harboring Kurdish terrorists. 

On the US front, the Justice Department is investigating TikTok for possible espionage activities against journalists. Meanwhile, there is new data that ties the origins of the pandemic to raccoon dogs that were being sold at a market in Wuhan. 

In sports-related news, Purdue has been doing well in the NCAA basketball tournament this year. Xavier was also able to fend off an upset bid by No. 14 seed Kennesaw State in their latest game. Sadly, we lost Lance Reddick of The Wire fame early this week at 60 years old. Finally, after a police killing of Walter Scott back in 2015, North Charleston PD has been taking steps to increase diversity and reduce traffic stops in their department as they try to rebuild trust with their community.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
