<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening in the world right now. In the US, the Senate is debating legislation on military aid to Ukraine and Israel. Biden&#39;s strategy on dealing with Israeli forces in Gaza is also being tested. Meanwhile, a House resolution that declares anti-Zionism as antisemitism has divided Democrats. On the campaign trail, Biden says he wouldn&#39;t have run for a second term if he weren&#39;t running against Trump. Trump and his team might use more power if they are returned to power, and Tuberville is letting most military promotions move forward despite originally blocking them. There&#39;s also Republican pushback against Harvard, MIT, and Penn over antisemitism on campus. Jewish American families have had to confront a divide between generations when it comes to their views about Israel. Gov. Hochul had a secret meeting with Tom Suozzi that cleared the way for his return and George Santos is making money off of Cameo videos.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
