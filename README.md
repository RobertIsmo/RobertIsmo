<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been a lot of news coming out of the US recently: a report summarizing the I.R.S. examination of Trump’s tax returns, an I.R.S. policy requiring them to audit presidents in office, Congress passing a spending bill that includes billions for Ukraine and other provisions, as well as a fight over the new F.B.I. headquarters location. Additionally, the spending bill includes several provisions to make it easier for Americans saving for retirement.

Also in the US, restrictions from the Trump-era are still in place at the border, and now Elon Musk is considering stepping down as the CEO of Twitter.

On a more international level, the Taliban has started bar women from college classes in Afghanistan and also released two Americans who were detained there - one of which was an independent filmmaker who had been held since August.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
