<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot going on in the world. The US economy is doing well and growth rate has been increasing over the summer. In Europe, the Central Bank has decided to keep interest rates on hold for the first time this year. In Israel, there have been severe attacks from both sides, with heavy military strikes against targets in Gaza and soldiers defending houses against terrorists in Ofakim. Closer to home, Mike Johnson from Louisiana was elected to be the new House Speaker, and his views on fossil fuels and climate change have come into question. Lastly, Trump faces legal issues as prosecutors try to reinstate a gag order on him while ex-loyalists have begun to cooperate in a case against him in Georgia.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
