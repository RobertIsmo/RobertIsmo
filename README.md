<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In Gaza, the war has taken an especially hard toll on children, making it like a graveyard for them. Northern Gaza has been left with devastation and disfigurement due to the conflict. In Israel, there is debate over how long it will take for the military to present definitive proof of something they have accused a hospital of. 

In tech news, Sam Altman stepped down as CEO of OpenAI and Mira Murati has been named interim CEO. There has also been a lot of controversy surrounding Elon Musk&#39;s endorsement of an antisemitic post leading major corporations to stop advertising on his social media platform X (formerly Twitter).

On a more lighthearted note, R&amp;B singer Cassie Ventura settled her lawsuit alleging rape and abuse by Sean Combs. Additionally, sex workers have been struggling to gain access to financial services because many banks deem the industry too high-risk. An article was even published discussing ways to keep your bank from suddenly closing your accounts.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
