<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, the potential charges against former President Donald Trump include the civil rights law used in voting fraud cases. Meanwhile, a judge has ruled that the hush money case against Trump will remain in New York State court, and Stanford&#39;s president is resigning after a report found flaws in his research. 

In China, President Biden&#39;s climate envoy emerged without a new agreement after meeting with President Xi, but both sides made progress in their talks. In Russia, they are hitting grain ports and threatening ships headed to Ukraine, and there are allegations of a deal between Putin and a mercenary chief. 

In Britain, the low numbers of king salmon has sparked conversations about whether we should be eating them. In Texas, there are reports of new border tactics that are injuring migrants. And New York City is telling migrants there&#39;s &quot;no guarantee&quot; of finding help there.

Finally, Cannes Film Festival 2021 saw the premier of Christopher Nolan&#39;s movie about J Robert Oppenheimer, described as a brilliant achievement.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
