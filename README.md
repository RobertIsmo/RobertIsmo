<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey friend, it&#39;s been a while! A lot has happened in the world since we last talked. In Russia, things have been tough in recent years. It looks like a war that Russian President Vladimir Putin started a few years ago has been an absolute catastrophe for their country.

In the US, there&#39;s been some drama with political donations by cryptocurrency executives. It&#39;s raised some serious concerns about campaign finance, which is getting investigated by federal prosecutors.

Restaurateur and big Republican donor Ryan Salame is also making the headlines lately. He bought some restaurants and also tipped off regulators about potential wrongdoing at an exchange he works with.

On a lighter note, Argentina has turned to witchcraft to help its national soccer team! Hundreds of &#39;brujas&#39; have been casting spells to protect their star player Lionel Messi and his team mates ahead of the World Cup. 

In 2022, San Francisco may look quite different too. Restaurants are looking to expand out of downtown, tech workers are still at home, and the city is making some changes to stop people from tampering with their license plates and illegally avoiding payment and fines (which costs them over $100 million a year). 

Oh, did I mention NFL? The 2022 playoffs have already begun! An interactive calculator lets people explore each team&#39;s path to make it there. 
Anyway, glad we got to catch up!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
