<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. Business news includes regulators closing banks and trying to protect deposits from Silicon Valley Bank&#39;s collapse. There was also a risky bet on a crypto investment that tanked Signature Bank. In climate news, the Silicon Valley Bank collapse is now threatening climate start-ups, plus the Biden administration is approving a huge Alaska oil project while putting limits on Arctic drilling in an effort to mitigate its climate impact. On the arts side, the futuristic movie &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; won seven Oscars, including best picture. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine is disrupting Swiss neutrality and putting it to the test. In sports, there&#39;s seedings for the NCAA men&#39;s tournament showing a wide-open field, with South Carolina topping the NCAA women&#39;s tournament field. And there&#39;s now an NCAA men&#39;s tournament bracket up so you can make your picks!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
