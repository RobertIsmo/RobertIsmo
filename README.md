<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, former President Donald Trump will not be attending the first GOP debate, and Florida Governor DeSantis is facing a difficult challenge ahead of it. Elsewhere, Hurricane Hilary is moving north and Tropical Storms are rare but catastrophic in California. In New England, severe storms are bringing tornadoes and in Ukraine, there have been nearly 500,000 troop deaths and injuries in the war that’s being fought there. Additionally, Donald Trump has four separate criminal indictments against him and he is at risk of trial before the election. Lastly, wildfires in Canada are worsening and evacuations have been issued for hundreds of miles away in some places.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
