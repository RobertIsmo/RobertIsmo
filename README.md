<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the United States, five police officers are facing the same set of charges, and President Biden is hammering Republicans on the economy in anticipation of 2024 elections. There has also been a mass shooting of farmworkers in Half Moon Bay California, which has shaken the immigrant community there, and John Durham was tasked with finding flaws in the Russia investigation. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy showed momentum at year&#39;s end defying recession fears, while Anthony Kim decided to walk away from golf despite having been compared to Tiger Woods. Other major news includes a man being convicted in a terror attack that killed 8 on a Manhattan bike path and China cracking down on protesters with efforts to blame foreign powers. Finally, there have never been as many official areas for skateboarding as there are today in New York City, but skaters still love and resist skateboard parks.</p>

<h3>He Was Compared to Tiger Woods. So Why Did He Walk Away From Golf?</h3>

<p>Is it OK for an athlete — or anyone, really — to have an extraordinary gift and not use it? The golfer Anthony Kim apparently decided, emphatically, that it is.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3H9wmTB"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>In China’s Crackdown on Protesters, a Familiar Effort to Blame Foreign Powers</h3>
<sub>By Vivian Wang and Zixu Wang</sub>
<p>The protests against “zero Covid” were a rare rebuke of Xi Jinping’s rule, and Beijing apparently seeks to deter those who might have been emboldened by them.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3R90lzC"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>The Mecca of New York Skateboarding, Back From the Dead?</h3>

<h3>Why Skaters Love and Resist Skateboard Parks</h3>
<sub>By Cole Louison</sub>
<p>There have never been as many official places to skate in New York City as there are today. But there’s just something about an empty plaza and a distracted security guard.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Xy0fE5"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
