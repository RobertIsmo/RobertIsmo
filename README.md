<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot of tension in the Middle East due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. In France, there was a huge march against antisemitism recently to address the rise in tensions. In the US, Chris Christie recently spoke out about President Trump&#39;s rhetoric of intolerance and lack of ambition in regards to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The FBI is also currently assessing whether a 2021 Democratic mayoral primary winner has been cutting red tape for the Turkish government. Additionally, the US has been carrying out airstrikes on Iran-linked targets in Syria. 

On the domestic front, there are &#39;Georgists&#39; advocating for a tax on land to address the crisis in affordable housing, while President Biden is pushing to fulfill some of his 2020 campaign promises like stopping border wall construction and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Furthermore, tragedy struck in Alabama when the mayor committed suicide after being accused of writing erotic fiction and posts featuring local people including a minor. In Maui, they are still trying to make sense of an inferno that left many people trapped. 

Finally, a new gene-editing treatment that could significantly reduce cholesterol levels for patients at risk of heart disease has had promising results in a small study. Vietnamese American shrimpers in Texas are having to look for new opportunities as their industry continues its decline. Lastly, remote work has been seen as advantageous for women who can still stay in the workforce but could potentially lead to less advancement opportunities than before.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
