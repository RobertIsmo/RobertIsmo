<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the U.S. is facing some budget cuts under President Biden and Republicans have to come to an agreement on debt limit issues. In other news, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been re-elected as Turkey&#39;s president, which could potentially change the country&#39;s relationship with Sweden in NATO. The former president, Donald Trump, is trying to build a crowd for 2024 and more candidates are joining in the mix. Additionally, a tragedy in a small town recently became a right-wing talking point and was distorted by Trump’s megaphone. Lastly, Ukraine has started using wind power as it&#39;s harder to destroy than regular power plants and the Republican Party&#39;s rifts have grown in Texas due to conflicts between moderates and hard-liners.</p>

<h3>Why Spending Cuts Likely Won’t Shake the Economy</h3>

<h3>What’s in the Bipartisan Debt Limit Agreement</h3>

<h3>Five Takeaways From Turkey’s Presidential Election</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
