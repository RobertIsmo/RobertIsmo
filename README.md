<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening right now around the world. In the United States, people are preparing to vote in the Chicago mayoral election while Republican donors in New York await a parade of potential presidential candidates. Meanwhile, in Ukraine there is a war which is being discussed in terms of peace negotiation and Russian forces have been making forays into Ukrainian lines. There&#39;s also a legal battle emerging in the Supreme Court over President Biden&#39;s plan to forgive $400 billion of student loan debt. 

In other parts of the world, Afghanistan is facing extreme winter temperatures and malnutrition as a result of a Taliban government ban on female workers that has hampered international aid efforts to the region. India is also seeing rapid increases in representation from Indian-Americans in politics that was unheard of just 10 years ago! 

On the business side of things, oil companies are laying off workers and shifting them over to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, but others worry that they don&#39;t have enough personnel outside the tech industry. Lastly, Twitter recently laid off at least 200 employees and now has a work force under 2,000 people. 

Interestingly, discussions are centering around a lab leak being responsible for causing the pandemic with America&#39;s intelligence agencies being split on their opinions. All this and more is happening right now!</p>

<h3>Indian Americans Rapidly Climbing Political Ranks</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
