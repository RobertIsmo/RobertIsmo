<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, November 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now. In some parts of the world, people are dealing with electronic warfare that is confusing civilian pilots and causing problems with GPS signals. There is also the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, which has been going for years and has led to a breakdown in communication between both sides. High tech companies are in the midst of turmoil due to concerns about the future of Artificial Intelligence, leading to big changes in leadership within these organizations. On a larger scale, nations are discussing limits on AI-controlled killer drones and debating over the use of autonomous arms. Meanwhile, there are massive numbers of migrants making their way to New York City and many other parts of the United States - seeking safety and trying to find ways to remain in the country legally. It&#39;s all very complicated and constantly changing, but the news continues to bring attention to all of these stories.</p>

<h3>Electronic Warfare Confounds Civilian Pilots, Far From Any Battlefield</h3>
<sub>By Selam Gebrekidan</sub>
<p>Planes were built to trust GPS signals. Jamming and spoofing in the Middle East and Ukraine have diverted flights and caused inaccurate onboard alerts.  <a href=""><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Was Peace Ever Possible?</h3>
<sub>Moderated by Emily Bazelon</sub>
<p>Thirty years ago, a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seemed achievable.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
