<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, October 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is unrest in the Middle East, with Israel and the Gaza Strip tense after Hamas attacked. Gazans released the names of over 6,000 people they believe were killed in Israeli strikes, which President Biden has said he has no confidence in. In Maine, a gunman killed 18 people at a bowling alley and bar; the suspect is an Army reservist. In other news from Maine, Republican representative Jared Golden reversed his stance on the ban of assault weapons. Across the US, there is controversy over university positions on DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) and transgender rights, as well as funding dilemmas. On a global level, Chinese premier Li Keqiang has died due to a heart attack. Meanwhile, Trump&#39;s former allies are testifying against him in criminal investigations in Manhattan and Georgia.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
