<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. The Federal Reserve has recently increased rates, meaning people with credit cards and loans should expect to pay more, while savers will get somewhat of a break. School curriculum is being adjusted in some places, as issues of racism and how they&#39;re addressed in education become more prominent topics of discussion. Also, there are powerful women at the helm of important Congressional and White House fiscal roles working to try and prevent an impending fiscal disaster. In other news, Russia has been building up military forces near its border with Ukraine, possibly signaling an imminent military invasions. Meanwhile, back at home, complex issues such as taxation and the migrant crisis are being faced head-on by politicians in New York, as well as elsewhere. On a more personal level, individuals dealing with menopause or ruminating thoughts have been given new advice on treatment and strategies for getting relief. And finally, there is the election season looming ahead with lots of debate about who Democrats should be voting for . . .</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
