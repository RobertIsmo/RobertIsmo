<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are several major events unfolding around the world right now. In the US, the Supreme Court recently issued rulings on affirmative action and student loans that could be significant for both college admissions and hiring practices. In addition, the justices provided significant wins for conservatives, but they&#39;ve also shown signs of caution in some of their decisions. 

Elsewhere, there have been tragedies at sea that appear to have been preventable - a migrant ship carrying hundreds of people sank while nearby vessels failed to respond to distress calls. In Russia, an uprising by an ally of Vladimir Putin provided a glimpse of what a new leadership could look like after his departure. And in Ukraine, there are reports of Wagner troops arriving in Belarus which has raised tensions in the region. 

Finally, here in France we are dealing with our own crisis right now. A young man was shot and killed by police near Paris, sparking protests and riots throughout many suburbs as residents struggle with racial tensions. President Macron had to cancel a state visit to Germany in response and is working to resolve the situation here at home.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
