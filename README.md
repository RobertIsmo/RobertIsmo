<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
At the moment, tensions are rising between the US and China over some surprising reports of UFOs and accusations of spy programs. On top of that, there have been huge protests in Israel surrounding Prime Minister Netanyahu&#39;s plans to limit judicial influence. Closer to home in the US, Republicans are facing party divisions preventing them from passing certain laws they had planned to, such as cracking down on unauthorized immigrants and providing law enforcement support. Additionally, a New York representative is being investigated for not accounting for hundreds of thousands of dollars of spending. Overseas, Syria recently experienced an earthquake and aid hasn&#39;t been able to reach one hard-hit region - however, there has been some progress in terms of President Assad opening up two more border crossings to help with relief efforts. There also appears to be a design flaw with certain buildings that were &quot;unexpectedly&quot; destroyed by the quake. Here in the US, a college board is having conflicts due to potential black panther associations when trying to introduce an AP Black Studies course. And finally, Florida&#39;s Governor DeSantis is gaining strong approval from Republicans which is putting him in a rare category at this stage of the primary cycle.</p>

<h3>They Were Told Their Building Was Earthquake Safe. It Collapsed Anyway.</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
