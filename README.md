<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things going on in the world right now. For example, after a Hamas attack in Israel, people are coming forward to talk about their traumatic experiences. In the US, officials are outlining steps to help reduce civilian casualties. As a result, thousands are marching for a cease-fire and lifting of the siege in major cities across the US. On the political front, some Republicans in Colorado are pushing for an alternative to Congresswoman Lauren Boebert&#39;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; incident, while Nikki Haley and her rivals for the Republican nomination face legal and logistical barriers when it comes to immigration. Meanwhile, Argentina’s far right politician Javier Milei is being opposed by legions of Taylor Swift and BTS fans. In Senegal, one young entrepreneur is using A.I. to attempt to quash malaria. In California, an Indian-culture senior living company called Priya Living is expanding into other states and India. In Phoenix there was an encampment of homeless people that also had to disbanded recently. And finally for marathoners, New York City marathon has put up lactation tents to support new moms on race day!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
