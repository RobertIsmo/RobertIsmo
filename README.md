<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson have both been accused of breaking rules, but they’ve had very different results – while Johnson has been trying to honor allies, Trump is facing an indictment that is causing chaos in the GOP. On top of that, Southern Baptists are fighting over female leaders in their denomination, and UCLA EV ride-sharing program is bringing low-cost clean transportation to a rural area of California. There’s also some antiwar protesting going on in Russia, and Ukrainian troops are retaking villages from Russia at great risk. In the United States, the Justice Department is about to release a Minneapolis police review after George Floyd’s murder – which also sparked nationwide protests – and Bill Gates just visited China for the first time since 2019.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
