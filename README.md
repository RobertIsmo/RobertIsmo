<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, May 6, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are many nations that have had ties with the British monarchy that are now breaking away, while Britain’s new head of state has been in the public eye ever since he was a baby. In the US, some people that supported ex-President Donald Trump have been investigated for illegally tampering with an election and some of them have already taken legal plea deals. One rioter who attacked police during an incident connected to Trump has been given one of the longest sentences yet in those investigations. Advanced technology such as artificial intelligence is being discussed by national security officials, as they fear it could be used for military purposes. The controversial television presenter Tucker Carlson might be going back on air earlier than expected but Fox is not sure if they will let him. Jordan Neely was killed in May 2021; his killer hasn&#39;t been charged yet. If you come across someone exhibiting distressing behaviour, it&#39;s important to know how to respond and offer help in a safe manner. President Joe Biden recently stated that he knows more than most people due to his long political career, and this coincides with House Republicans rejecting the government&#39;s 2022 budget plan. One bill passed recently in Florida can void any approved development agreement between Walt Disney World and Governor DeSantis, while DeSantis is facing criticism due to numerous issues. Lastly, there has been a stay on an inmate called Richard Glossip that was scheduled for execution this May 18th in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
