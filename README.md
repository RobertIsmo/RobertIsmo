<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, July 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the business realm, a drug maker has been taking advantage of its patents to make more money. In technology, companies have been making commitments related to Artificial Intelligence. Meanwhile, some medical schools are using chatbots to train their students how to think like medical professionals.

In the world of politics, protests in Belarus have faced severe crackdowns and Turkish leaders have discussed a grain deal in light of recent tensions with Russia and Ukraine. Here in the US we&#39;re facing a crisis with how police interact with people who are experiencing mental health incidents. 

On the entertainment front, two big movies were supposed to be released, but the pandemic put a damper on any celebration. For those who do get to see them, one is a Christopher Nolan movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the other is Greta Gerwig&#39;s &quot;Barbie.&quot; Just recently, Sophia Smith had an incredible World Cup debut where she scored two goals and assisted another one as well. Lastly here in New York promises made by developers don&#39;t seem to have been kept when it comes to spacious public areas being offered in exchange for larger buildings. On top of that much of the southeast and southwest are experiencing some intense heat at the moment which is expected to abate slightly soon though dangerous temperatures could return later next week.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
