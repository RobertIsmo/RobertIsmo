<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been an attack on Israel by another country, and the US is trying to make sure they help Israel without alienating Ukraine, who they are also supportive of. Meanwhile, there is a criminal fraud trial for the founder of a crypto-currency exchange. The Republican party is deciding who to choose as their Speaker after the ouster of the former Speaker. Scientists have figured out a way to make chickens more resistant to bird flu, while a New York Times critic argues that this century has seen less innovation in the arts. The effects of remote work on people&#39;s lives and on the economy are still being discovered. There is also increasing criticism of Donald Trump from Florida Governor Desantis, while Vice President Kamala Harris is still trying to make her case to the American people. Finally, Netflix has released a new fantasy dramedy with Queen Margrethe II of Denmark as its costume and production designer.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
