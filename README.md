<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there’s a lot happening around the world. In the US, there recently was an earthquake in California that didn&#39;t cause too much damage. There’s also been lots of debates about whether police officers should wear body cameras and if they deserve pay increases. In the political landscape, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has made some changes to his messaging and tactics while running for re-election. Internationally, Tropical Storm Hilary is churning across the ocean and Spain won the FIFA World Cup, although a kiss between a soccer federation chief and a Spanish forward caused some controversy. Furthermore, Russia had a lunar lander crash on the moon while in Ecuador there&#39;s a runoff vote coming up between an establishment leftist and newcomer businessman.</p>

<h3>Think the Police Should Wear Body Cameras? That Will Cost Taxpayers Extra.</h3>

<p>The public increasingly expects that police interactions will be recorded. And police unions increasingly expect a raise for doing the recording.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3E1m9Yn"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>How Ron DeSantis Joined the ‘Ruling Class’ — and Turned Against It</h3>

<h3>For Spain, a World Cup Title Built on Talent, Not Harmony</h3>

<p>A team that had endured all that Spain has in the past 12 months should not be able to win a World Cup. And yet that is precisely what it did.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/45eVFP2"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
