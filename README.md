<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Donald Trump has been indicted over his role in paying hush money to a porn star, and he may surrender himself soon. Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has been silent on Trump&#39;s indictment. The former president and his supporting cast have returned to the media universe in a major way. An obscure change to the way regional banks are supervised has had a big impact on the financial industry, including companies like Schwab that hold billions of dollars in bonds. A large tornado hit Arkansas, and a court ruled that Fox News&#39;s defamation case against Dominion Voting Systems ought to go to trial. In other legal news, technology falsely identified one man for theft in a state he&#39;d never visited. An estate dispute is causing a rift among the children of an artist with a huge body of work worth millions of dollars. South Carolina’s women&#39;s basketball team is trying to win its second consecutive NCAA championship, and Medicare announced it will ease restrictions over-billing by private health plans over three years. Lastly, some people are even knitting during Zoom meetings as another way to focus their minds!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
