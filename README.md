<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is in a complicated place right now. In some countries, asylum seekers are facing criminal horrors and their cases are taking years to resolve. Meanwhile, after Title 42 expired in the U.S., there has been increased scrutiny of the police&#39;s growing presence in subway stations due to a recent chokehold killing. Governments are also changing policies to deal with COVID-19. For example, foreign travelers entering the country no longer need to be vaccinated and restrictions on travel that started in 2020 are ending. Finally, there are interesting stories of how people are creating new systems of living together, such as mommunes where groups of mothers are joining forces under one roof to split bills and raise children.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
