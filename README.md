<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is escalating conflict between Israel and Gaza, with hate speech and violence spiking across the internet. There are dire reports coming from Gaza about the situation in hospitals due to shortages of essential materials. In Israel, the war has resulted in dangerous rhetoric making inflammatory statements about the killings of civilians and mass deportations seem more normal. In the US, there is division and power struggles over fiscal issues, as well as a long-running abortion case that had significant repercussions in conservative politics and affected who was appointed speaker of the house. Meanwhile, the US and China have just agreed on ramping up use of renewables in order to displace fossil fuels, giving hope that it could lead to greater international environmental action. Finally, there is a variety of stories emerging involving international players; FIFA guided the World Cup to Saudi Arabia, thieves are stealing catalytic converters across the US that often end up overseas, and a major merger has put a cable executive in charge of Hollywood&#39;s largest studio.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
