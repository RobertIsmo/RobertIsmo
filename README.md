<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In Europe, there is an investigation into sabotage on a gas pipelines involving Russia. Meanwhile Ukraine is proposing a peace summit for February. In the US, people are still struggling to live and work with the COVID pandemic, while Democrats are pushing for more voting rights. In Asia, China is easing Covid travel restrictions after almost three years of lockdowns. The US has also seen its own share of tragedies; a blizzard has caused power outages in New York and the sister survivors of a mass shooting in Colorado are struggling this holiday season.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
