<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, November 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are regional rivals, but have recently come together to call for a cease-fire in Gaza, after heavy shelling from Israel. In the US, Donald Trump has plans to extend and toughen immigration policies if he regains power. He also recently gave a Veterans Day speech, vowing to “root out” leftists. He asked a judge to televise a federal election trial, but it&#39;s not likely that request will be granted. 

In Russia, there is a man going around to try to give decent burials to soldiers who died in WWII and were left on the battlefields. He even had to bury his own son as he fought in a war his father hates. In relation to Ukraine, Russia has recently launched missiles at Kyiv for the first time in weeks, as they seem to be testing their air defenses. 

A former Goldman Sachs trader is now causing stirrings in Greece&#39;s political sphere — Stefanos Kasselakis is the nation&#39;s first openly gay political leader, and people aren&#39;t sure whether his leadership will help or hurt the main opposition party. In the US, Senator Johnson is trying to pass a bill that would extend government funding until late January or early February, however it omits aid for countries such as Ukraine or Israel. 

Over in Delhi people are still being encouraged by local authorities to go out and exercise despite the toxic air levels — joggers and yoga fans aren&#39;t willing to miss out on their social routines. Finally, tropical birds have taken over Brussels, bringing a “splash of color” back into the city after they were once released from zoos in 1970s. And football is gaining more and more popularity across Europe — especially in Germany due to influence from U.S. troops after WWII, and an N.F.L game held there last year . There are also mentoring programs helping people who just started caring for family members with dementia understand everything they are going through emotionally, together with long-time caregivers</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
