<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things are heating up in Europe. A war is brewing in Ukraine and it has changed Europe for the long term - there&#39;s no going back now. In the east and south of Ukraine, Russian forces have been conducting artillery strikes that killed five civilians. To understand how we got here, we can look back to the roots of the crisis that are a year old. Additionally, over in China, they are quickly trying to rollback a host of birth limits and encourage people to have more babies as its population ages and declines. 

As we look back 30 years ago to February 26th when there was an attack on the twin towers at the World Trade Center - an ominous foreshadowing of 9&#x2F;11 that hasn&#39;t been forgotten. Meanwhile, the first female leader of the Treasury Janet Yellen recently had her signature put on a new batch of dollar bills. On top of that, a Times exposé recently revealed that young migrants from across the U.S. have been ending up in dangerous child labor jobs in factories - making products like Cheetos and Fruit of the Loom. And closer to home for us, there is a campaign going on to disparage a struggling hospital in Brooklyn that some are trying to &quot;fix&quot; with aggressive tactics - spending 1 million dollars doing so. 

Lastly, AI chatbots have been producing some strange results over the past few weeks due to people prodding them for answers, but also in Iran where women are defiantly resisting mandatory hijab laws with flowing hair or ponytails. And there is also NATO small nation Albania dealing with cyberattacks coming from Iran as they protect Iranian dissidents on their soil.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
