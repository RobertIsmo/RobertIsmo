<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are many important news stories happening around the world right now. In the US, President Biden is facing a decision on raising the nation&#39;s debt limit, which Republicans have paired with spending cuts and fossil fuel support. There is also a grand jury hearing involving former Vice President Pence and former President Trump&#39;s efforts to remain in power following the 2020 election. Joseph Tacopina, Trump&#39;s lawyer, is also sparring in court with a journalist who accused him of rape. Elsewhere, Carolyn Bryant Donham, a key witness to the Emmett Till case, passed away at age 88, and a transgender lawmaker in Montana is being barred from participating in legislative sessions. 

In New York, there is an agreement on a budget including a change in minimum wage; Ukrainians are fighting off Russian attacks in the hopes for help from Western arms; and an Airman has been ordered to stay in custody pending court motions. Finally, Jerry Springer has been featured in the news for his talk show which threw open studio doors to all sorts of issues.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
