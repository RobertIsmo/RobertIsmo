<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the news around the world has been quite hectic recently. Banks and the economy have been turbulent, with some bank executives trying to reassure customers with personal cell phone numbers and video chats. In terms of politics, there are ongoing tensions between Russia and the US, from a warplane hitting an American drone over the Black Sea to fierce political disagreements and finger-pointing. Furthermore, Ukraine is still in a state of unrest as shelling intensifies even after liberation attempts. 

In America, there&#39;s been a call to strengthen gun laws through executive order to improve background checks. Worse yet, California&#39;s weather is bringing more flooding warnings due to an atmospheric river resulting in lots of rainfall and high winds. 

On a lighter note, there have been encouraging developments like Wellesley College students voting to admit trans men and OpenAI releasing new tech called GPT-4.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
