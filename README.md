<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, April 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot going on in the world. In Ukraine, Europe pledged a million shells for their military defense against Russia, but experts say they won&#39;t be able to deliver due to their own military industrial sector shortages. In the US, leaked documents suggest Ukrainian air defense is in peril if not reinforced and the governor of Florida is pushing an aggressive proposal to penalize those who aid undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, people are taking notice of the real-world costs of digital Bitcoin mining as it affects electricity and causes immense pollution. Finally, Northern Ireland has been commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement amidst a legacy of bloody divisions.</p>

<h3>How the Latest Leaked Documents Are Different From Past Breaches</h3>

<p>The freshness of the documents — some appear to be barely 40 days old — and the hints they hold for operations to come make them particularly damaging, officials say.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3UoQnMb"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Europe Has Pledged a Million Shells for Ukraine in a Year. Can It Deliver?</h3>

<p>Probably not, experts say, given the shrunken state of its military industrial sector. A look at a major munitions maker helps explain why.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3GtzaLG"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Leaked Documents Suggest Ukrainian Air Defense Is in Peril if Not Reinforced</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
