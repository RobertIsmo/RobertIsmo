<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In terms of politics, the Republicans in the U.S. are blocking aid to Ukraine, endangering their fight against Russia. This has weakened support towards Ukraine from Congress. The controversy over funding to Ukraine has continued despite a legacy push by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. There have also been many debates between Republican candidates vying for the presidential nomination, but Donald Trump remains unscathed despite the feisty atmosphere of these debates. To top it off, House Republicans are threatening Hunter Biden with contempt charges after he refused to testify in private about his role in an impeachment involving President Biden.

In other news, there was a great loss for television this week with the passing of legendary producer Norman Lear at 101 years old. Lear was responsible for producing iconic shows like &quot;All in the Family&quot; which transformed the face of TV. Rob Reiner paid tribute to Lear, stating that he had never seen another show tap into something so powerful and popular as what &quot;All in the Family&quot; achieved. 

Finally, the White House has delayed its decision to ban menthol cigarettes after facing resistance from tobacco companies, Black activists concerned about police enforcement and small businesses. On top of that, there was a tragic shooting at University of Nevada Las Vegas that left three people dead and another person injured.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
