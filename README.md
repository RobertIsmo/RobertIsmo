<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world. In Russia and Ukraine, families in occupied areas have been facing a grim wait, while a recent Russian missile attack on an apartment block in Ukraine has left many dead. Meanwhile, in Bali, tensions between Russians and Ukrainians are still rising as thousands flee their homelands for the tropical paradise. Things don&#39;t seem to be much better here in the US either - there&#39;s disagreement over affirmative action and college admissions policies, while in one Pennsylvania county they&#39;ve just conducted a three-day recount of 2020 votes after election deniers requested it. California has been getting hit hard by multiple storms recently, resulting in 19 deaths so far. On the sports front, tennis star Nick Kyrgios is making waves with his unique playing style. And finally, there&#39;s been some interesting developments in the business world: salary information is becoming more public, while there are tips from psychologists out on how to successfully ask for a raise.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
