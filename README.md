<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. War in Ukraine has China prospering from its trade with Russia this year; it&#39;s about to surpass $200 billion in total, and car&#x2F;truck makers have been the biggest winners. Additionally, Donald Trump is facing legal battles challenging his eligibility for the next election, which could reshape the 2024 election if it goes to the Supreme Court. His opponents are wary of attacking him however, as Trump&#39;s ruled ineligible for the ballot in Colorado. Biden&#39;s poll numbers haven&#39;t been looking too good either, so he&#39;s sticking with his strategy of comparing their agenda with one of the Republicans instead of changing course yet. But the Senate has made steady progress on a package as for Ukraine military assistance exchange for tougher border policies; they hope to make a deal soon with that. Lastly, there are rumors going around that Warner Bros. Discovery is potentially merging with Paramount.</p>
