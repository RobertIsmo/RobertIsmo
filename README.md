<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news from around the world right now. Economists are predicting a growth rebound in spite of rising interest rates, and many large companies are increasing prices without much resistance from shoppers. The US government has accused the Chinese military of using surveillance balloons to collect communications signals, and in response, is preparing new rules to restrict investments in China. In Syria, an underground hospital filled with earthquake victims is facing tragedy but in Russia, the government has stopped recruiting prisoners to fight in Ukraine. On a more positive note, music legend Burt Bacharach passed away at 94 and George Toma, the groundskeeper for all 57 Super Bowls will be honored on Sunday. Lastly, President Biden is currently visiting Florida and sending a message to House Republicans about cutting Medicare and Social Security.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
