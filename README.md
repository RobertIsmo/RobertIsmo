<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some worrying developments going on around the world right now. In Turkey, a key election which could decide the country&#39;s future has gone to round two as no majority was reached. In Ukraine, there&#39;s a long and bloody battle continuing for Bakhmut as Russia controls most of it. In the US, people are still migrating in droves due to economic hardships, climate change and gang violence, despite Title 42 being gone. Meanwhile, some companies are taking new approaches to &#39;diversity and belonging&#39; instead of &#39;diversity and inclusion&#39;, and in India &#39;witch hunts&#39; are still occurring in some communities. Finally, with the greatest wealth transfer in history underway in the US due to surges in home and stock values, many of the trillions of dollars will go to reinforcing existing inequality. Opinions on these matters vary but, ultimately, it seems like this is an issue where the rule of law is failing us.</p>

<h3>How to Raise $89 Million in Small Donations, and Make It Disappear</h3>
<sub>By David A. Fahrenthold, Tiff Fehr and Charlie Smart</sub>
<p>A group of conservative operatives using sophisticated robocalls raised millions of dollars from donors using pro-police and pro-veteran messages. But instead of using the money to promote issues and candidates, an analysis by The New York Times shows, nearly all the money went to pay the firms making the calls and the operatives themselves.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/42RRXZP"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
