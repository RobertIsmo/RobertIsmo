<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of unrest in the world right now. In the US, legal arguments are being made to challenge abortion bans and conversations about race, policing, and police reform are taking place. In Israel, violence has erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinians in the wake of an Israeli military raid. Meanwhile there are tensions and battles occurring between Russia and Ukraine over control of villages, particularly near the key city of Bakhmut. And survivors of conflict are trickling back into reclaimed cities in Ukraine but still with signs that conflict might return. On top of that, Serbia&#39;s Novak Djokovic won his 10th Australian Open Men&#39;s Singles title. On the business side, private equity is now making moves to acquire toddler gyms. As for NFL players, the injury to Damar Hamlin has highlighted their precarious position in the league and Howie Roseman from the Eagles has managed to rebuild his team to championship aspirations in five short seasons. Lastly, a football super fan celebrated for dressing up in a wolf costume ended up unexpectedly in a Tulsa jail which sent Kansas City fans into confusion.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
