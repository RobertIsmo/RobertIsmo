<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been some intense news coming from around the world recently. In Mississippi, a powerful tornado left at least 23 people dead and dozens more injured while in Ukraine, U.S. volunteers stationed there have reportedly been lying, wasting and bickering. Further conflict has escalated in Syria after an attack that killed one U.S. contractor and wounded six others, and many Ukrainians are facing dire conditions near Bakhmut. Closer to home, stolen guns are becoming an issue due to a rise in firearms kept in vehicles and the debate over gun safety follows suit. Meanwhile, elderly Italians are relying on robots for care while countries seek N.C.A.A glory at Madison Square Garden. In more recent news, former Trump officials must testify in 2020 election inquiries, Gordon E. Moore (co-founder of Intel) recently passed away at 94 and the weekend edition covers Beethoven&#39;s DNA secrets and a review of the show &quot;Succession&quot;.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
