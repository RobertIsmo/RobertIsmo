<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to let you know what&#39;s been going on in the world, as it&#39;s been pretty intense lately. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a lot of domestic pressure due to hostage deaths in Gaza, and there are also over 100 members of a single family that have been killed in the war between Israel and Hamas. Meanwhile, Russia&#39;s President Putin is taking advantage of Western boycotts for his own gain, while Hungary&#39;s Prime Minister Orban was able to stop an E.U. package that was intended to aid Ukraine.

Here in the US, there has been some scandal shaking up a conservative group called Moms For Liberty, while Florida Republicans have stripped powers from their party chairman who is currently under investigation. Abortion rights could also be shifting with Post-Roe voting, and universities are coming down on pro-Palestinian speech out of fear of being labeled antisemitic. Finally, many Jews at Harvard are feeling alone and estranged after a trying week on campus. 

We&#39;re also seeing an overlooked crisis in Congo that has left 6 million dead and displaced over 6 million more in the eastern region of the country - there is definitely tension leading into its upcoming election.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
