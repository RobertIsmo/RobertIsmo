<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, January 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Bali, Russians and Ukrainians who have escaped war in their homelands are learning how to live together peacefully. In Ukraine, a Russian missile attack destroyed an apartment block and left dozens dead. In California, yet another storm has caused serious damage, taking at least 19 lives in its wake. A plane crash in Nepal also killed 68 people. On a lighter note, The New York Times recently released their list of the top places to travel to for 2023 so there are some exciting opportunities for exploration if the pandemic subsides soon. Finally, the University of Auburn recently banned TikTok which has become quite a topic of discussion among students!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
