<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;ve been a lot of events happening around the world recently. An earthquake in Morocco caused fear and chaos for victims, while Vietnam is trying to strengthen its military by buying weapons from Russia, which might violate U.S. sanctions. The G20 also invited the African Union to join, expanding the ‘Global South’s reach further. In America, an appeals court ruled that the White House overstepped its First Amendment rights on social media. There&#39;s also a situation going on in Florida&#39;s education system that Ben Sasse is trying to intervene in. A federal judge denied Mark Meadows&#39; request to move a Georgia case to federal court and Yuscil Taveras, a Trump employee, is facing charges after being caught up in the Trump documents case. Meanwhile, former US President Donald Trump was recently indicted for the fourth time and recently ranted about it at a South Dakota rally. On the other side of the world, Elon Musk refused to allow Ukraine to use his Starlink satellite network for drone attacks against a Russian fleet. Lastly, Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka both got through to the U.S. Open Championship finals!</p>

<h3>Judge Denies Meadows’s Request to Move Georgia Case to Federal Court</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
