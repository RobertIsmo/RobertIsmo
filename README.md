<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Many things are going on in the world right now. In the US, the House recently passed a defense bill, but it will likely not survive in the Senate due to a variety of social policy provisions that were included. In New York, someone was arrested for the serial killing of women near Gilgo Beach, and the police chief has brought a renewed sense of urgency to what was once a cold case. In Hollywood, Fran Drescher (who is most famous for her role as &quot;The Nanny&quot;) is now the president of an actors&#39; union that is preparing to go on strike. Meanwhile,in Ukraine, there are villages destroyed by war that have become overgrown with weeds and largely forgotten. And Europe is once again dealing with a major heat wave.</p>

<h3>House Narrowly Passes Defense Bill, Setting Up Showdown Over Social Issues</h3>

<h3>The Economic Stakes in the Hollywood Shutdown</h3>

<h3>Ruined, Empty, Mined and Overgrown: Ukraine’s Forgotten Villages</h3>

<p>Settlements along Ukraine’s eastern steppe were reduced to wreckage as the war passed through them.

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
