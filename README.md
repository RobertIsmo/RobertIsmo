<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, tensions are high in Israel as they expand their offensive in Gaza and residents are being told to leave their homes. The US is trying to get Israel and Hamas to resume talks, and the White House has put the blame on Hamas for the breakdown of negotiations. Meanwhile, US Navy Destroyers have been shooting down drones in the Red Sea after several commercial ships nearby came under attack from Iran-backed Yemeni Houthis. 

In other news, there are a lot of questions surrounding artificial intelligence and the people who are most afraid of its risks have decided to be the ones to build it. This has created a spiraling competition among tech companies and investors. In response, mainstream companies have looked for ways to identify A.I data they can trust. This competition has also extended to Chinese migrants crossing southern borders into the US in hopes of a better life. 

Finally at home, people like doctors and pharmacists are revolting against long-standing conditions such as secrecy for sperm and egg donation that queer families have raised concerns about, and which could be addressed in a Supreme Court ruling. At the same time, there&#39;s some apprehension among liberal college professors in Florida where Governor DeSantis has threatened to pass laws superseding Obamacare.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
