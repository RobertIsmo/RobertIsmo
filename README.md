<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, Hurricane Idalia has just made landfall in Florida and is threatening to move through the southeastern United States, potentially bringing flooding, storm surge, and even tornadoes. Here in the US, we&#39;re also facing a scary problem -- groundwater overuse. Aquifers have been drained and damaged nationwide, threatening millions of people. On top of that, US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has met with top government officials in Beijing to address US concerns about harsh treatment of foreign companies and national security issues there. In China itself, while the government is continuing its pep talks about the country&#39;s economic outlook, there seem to be widespread anxiety and pessimism about their economic slowdown on the ground. Lastly, former President Donald Trump has challenged his trial date in a federal election case, situation that legal experts don&#39;t seem too optimistic about.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
