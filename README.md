<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>A lot is going on in the world right now! President Biden is giving a speech to the United Nations advocating for democracy and global leadership. At the same time, UN Chief Antonio Guterres is chastening those who are not doing enough to combat climate change. New genetic research shows that a nomadic people living in Indonesia&#39;s rainforest have their own unique language. Autoworkers represented by the UAW are staging a strike with major implications for labor movements across the US. The Restaurant List has chosen 50 places in the US that they&#39;re most excited about. On the world stage, Ukrainian soldiers were captured firing at unseen enemies and recent evidence suggests that a Ukrainian missile caused a high casualty rate in a market recently. For its part, Russia has wrongfully detained an American journalist covering an espionage case and US-Canada relations are getting tense as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accuses India of killing a Sikh man on Canadian soil. In comparison, Los Angeles has been able to avoid the migrant crisis hitting New York City due to fewer immigrants coming into the region.</p>

<h3>Why Los Angeles Has Avoided the Migrant Crisis Hitting New York</h3>
<sub>By Jill Cowan and Miriam Jordan</sub>
<p>The Southern California city so far has avoided the desperate situation that other metro areas are facing, in part because it no longer attracts as many immigrants as it once did.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/48jZap4"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
