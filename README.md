<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of developments happening in the world right now. The Federal Reserve has left interest rates unchanged and is projecting three quarter-point rate cuts next year, which has caused stocks to rally and bond yields to slide. In the US, the House has approved an impeachment inquiry into President Biden despite no evidence of any high crimes or misdemeanors being found. Separately, the Senate passed a defense bill without any far-right policy dictations while negotiations for a border deal are still ongoing. The Supreme Court has also agreed to hear a challenge to abortion pill access as well as an obstruction charge case related to former President Trump&#39;s involvement in the January 6th insurrection. Finally, the Education Department is investigating six more colleges over campus discrimination.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
