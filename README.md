<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To a close friend, I&#39;d sum up what is happening in the world right now as steadily improving relations between the US and Israel. Biden has invited Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to the US to ease tensions, and President Herzog of Israel is visiting the White House soon. At the same time, tensions between Democrats are flaring over Israel, especially amongst progressive members. Republicans have also stepped in to criticize Democrats at the Christians United for Israel Summit. On the economic side, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is having luck bringing back labor market success while trying to prevent it from weakening again. There are also some issues around antiquities being seized from home collections and a break in grain deals between Russia and Ukraine that is shaking world food markets. Additionally, Trump and allies are looking to increase presidential power in 2025, while here in New York City a federal prosecutor wants to take over Rikers Island jail complex and Edward Caban has become the first Latino Police Commissioner for the NYPD. Iowa has also temporarily suspended its new abortion ban. Lastly, a family of a boat crash victim in Florida has reached a $15 million settlement.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
