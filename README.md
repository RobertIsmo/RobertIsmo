<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening around the world. In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is being pressured by the U.S. to delay an overhaul of the judicial system after protests have been organized by citizens. In the U.S., authorities responded to a heavily armed assailant at a Christian elementary school in Nashville and six people were killed, including three children. In China, cities are buried in debt but are continuing to spend heavily, while Beijing is providing emergency funds to other debt-ridden countries. Finally, in Ukraine, the former director of Europe&#39;s largest nuclear facility has spoken out about torture and turmoil there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
