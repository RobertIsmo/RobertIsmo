<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is facing some pretty serious conflicts. One of the most pressing is the attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen. On top of that, Hamas is also conducting an unprecedented hostage situation in the Gaza strip. In response, Israel&#39;s security services have failed to stop the violence—an unusual occurrence given their reputation for excellence. Meanwhile, back in the US, Republicans are deadlocked on choosing a Speaker for their caucus, and in Afghanistan locals are grappling with the aftermath of two strong earthquakes that have caused immense devastation. To top it off, Russia has now launched an offensive against Ukraine near a southeastern town called Avdiivka. Fortunately, Ukrainian President Zelensky is now receiving help from NATO forces to push back on their attackers.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
