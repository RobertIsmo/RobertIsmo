<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world has a lot going on right now. In the U.K., negotiations between the government and the E.U. have been ongoing over post-Brexit rules known as the Northern Ireland protocol, and they finally reached an agreement. In Russia, conscripts are being sent to the border of Ukraine, while in America, chip makers are being incentivized with federal funds to provide child care to help increase female participation in the work force. The Supreme Court is hearing arguments on President Biden&#39;s plan to forgive about $400 billion in student loan debt and challenging the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well. There&#39;s also a case on whether states have special rights to sue federal programs, and questions surrounding Biden&#39;s student loan forgiveness plan. Additionally, discussions of ethical ways to kill rats, questions around New York&#39;s gun laws post-Supreme Court overturning century-old regulations, Indian Americans making strides into politics, and the upcoming mayoral election in Chicago featuring Lori Lightfoot plus many challengers attacking her record led by Elissa Slotkin who announced her Senate run for Michigan are all making headlines.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
