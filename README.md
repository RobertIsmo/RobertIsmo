<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now, from a potential homelessness crisis in New York City to worries over the US credit rating being downgraded. In Kyiv, there is a push to reduce the influence of an Orthodox Church that follows Moscow&#39;s lead. On the economic front, stocks and Treasury yields are fluctuating as people weigh up positive news about the economy, while the Bank of England has increased rates for the 14th meeting in a row. There are serious climate concerns as it&#39;s been reported that this year&#39;s ocean heat is &#39;astonishing&#39;, and South Korea is currently suffering its hottest summer in years. Meanwhile Senator Dianne Feinstein is unwell and there&#39;s internal strife within her family over the control of her late husband&#39;s estate. Finally, Twitter&#39;s CEO Elon Musk has rebranded his company and lots of people are trying to make sense of what that means!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
