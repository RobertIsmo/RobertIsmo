<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news happening around the world right now. In Ukraine, troops are trying to repel Russian attacks and are hoping that Western arms will help turn the tide of the fight with heavy casualties but little movement. In the US, former Vice President Mike Pence is appearing before a grand jury to testify on former President Donald Trump&#39;s efforts to retain power. Trump&#39;s lawyer is currently sparring with E. Jean Carroll over allegations of rape made against him.  Carolyn Bryant Donham, who accused Emmett Till of accosting her leading to his eventual execution has passed away at 88. A transgender lawmaker in Montana is being exiled since Republicans have gained more power and Montana&#39;s governor&#39;s nonbinary son is asking him not to sign any bills that could harm the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Biden is also facing his first big decision surrounding the debt limit where Republicans are trying to find a balance between spending cuts and increasing the nation&#39;s borrowing cap and this decision could change things going forward significantly. Lastly, Judy Blume&#39;s famous coming-of-age story is coming out on the big screen and New York is making changes to their minimum wage and $229 billion budget deal after leaders in Albany went back and forth for weeks on it and Afghan women who were part of a combat unit in Afghanistan are asking Congress for permanent legal status after they were evacuated during the U.S.&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan while U.N also unanimously condemned Taliban&#39;s treatment of women in a resolution and called for them to end prohibitions on women attending school past 6th grade and other work related restrictions as well.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
