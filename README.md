<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a growing crisis in Israel over what kind of state it should be as there have recently been court rulings and fighting in Gaza. In Japan, a plane at an airport exploded into flames earlier this week and unfortunately five crew members on a Coast Guard plane that collided with it were killed. Moreover, the death toll is rising after a powerful earthquake in the same region. On a different note, India has been trying to boost its economy and foreign investment with infrastructure spending, while Britain&#39;s is being held back by issues such as their power grid and local planning authorities. Additionally, there&#39;s a heated debate in paleontology going on regarding the naming of one of the dinosaur fossils that is up for sale in London. Furthermore, the leader of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, is currently facing trial for decades of corruption and Harvard&#39;s president is facing new plagiarism accusations. Lastly, President Trump&#39;s 2024 election has started to become a definitive test for America.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
