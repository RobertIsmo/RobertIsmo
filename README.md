<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a lot going on in the world. In Mexico, the police, military officers and others have been secretly working with a cartel that was responsible for kidnapping 43 students nine years ago. In the US, President Biden is struggling to make his policies on the economy popular among Americans and he is visiting Florida to survey the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia. Meanwhile, a small-scale counteroffensive is being waged in Ukraine against Russian forces and tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been simmering over an attack on a bridge that links occupied Crimea to Russia. Additionally, Montana has made headlines as one of its top elected officials prioritized banning TikTok, putting the state in the center of a geopolitical storm. Finally, at the US Open, granules of sand that shape court surfaces and the difficult process of becoming a ballperson are some of the events making news on the sports front.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
