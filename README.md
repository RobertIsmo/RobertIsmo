<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like there&#39;s no shortage of news these days. In the United States, there&#39;s the ongoing uncertainty over the Trump election indictment, and his legal team being enmeshed in a tangle of possible conflicts. Meanwhile on a global scale, Ukraine is making diplomatic efforts to weaken Russia and Russia is accusing Ukraine of attacking one of its oil tankers near a bridge. There&#39;s also a web of Chinese propaganda being uncovered that involves an American tech mogul. Arts and sports are still going strong as Taylor Swift tours the world with her record-breaking show and the Women&#39;s World Cup has been serving up some amazing soccer goals. Lastly, Big Tech companies have found financial footing again and are investing in Artificial Intelligence technology like never before!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
