<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, June 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In the US, former President Donald Trump is facing legal charges and citizens from Florida are talking about how they feel about him. On the international level, NATO members are holding large-scale war games in a show of strength towards Russia, while US lawmakers are pressuring the White House for penalties against South Africa for supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. There is also a court trail in Montana between young climate activists and the state of Montana about policies that contribute to climate change. In terms of news closer to home, New York City recently set a minimum wage for food delivery workers, while the city&#39;s police commissioner abruptly resigned but did not disclose any reason. Finally, away from more serious issues, there is an undiscovered group of small wineries producing delicious wine just an hour away from Silicon Valley in California.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
