<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is currently going through a lot of changes. In the US, former president Donald Trump&#39;s personal lawyer is being questioned about his attempts to remain in power after the election, and Florida governor DeSantis is facing scrutiny for a taxpayer-funded helicopter ride in Texas. On the international stage, Russia&#39;s President Putin has announced plans to punish allies of Wagner group leader Prigozhin, and satellite images have revealed possible new homes for Wagner mercenaries. There is also destruction and death from a Russian missile strike in Ukraine, as well as suspected human remains being recovered from a lost Titan vessel off Newfoundland. Scientists are also finding evidence of gravitational waves being emitted from supermassive black holes in the early universe. Closer to home, climate change is an issue with a new study linking smoke pollution across the US to individual wildfires. Meanwhile, New York City is seeing record numbers of homeless people while voting in cities like Harlem indicate a generational power shift toward moderate candidates. Finally, a floating supermarket known as Aquidaban is at risk of disappearing along South America&#39;s remote stretches.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
