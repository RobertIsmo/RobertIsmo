<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of tension surrounding immigration right now. U.S. President Biden is facing pressure from members of his own party to solve the overcrowding in migrant encampments and shelters. Ambulance workers in Texas, near the border, are feeling the strain of the crisis, as are New York City officials who are being confronted with tens of thousands of migrants being sent their way. On top of this, the Trump administration accepted millions of dollars from foreign entities while in office, and Republicans are trying to hold Biden to a similar standard. Meanwhile, there have been a series of bombings in Iran that Islamic State has claimed responsibility for. Iraq is also condemning the U.S. after an airstrike in Baghdad killed a militant leader with ties to their government. Closer to home, there was a school shooting in Iowa where a sixth grader was killed and five others injured, and here in New York, two subway trains collided causing several injuries but no deaths. Finally, an oligarch is suing Sotheby’s auction house for tricking him into overspending on artworks.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
