<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the United States, President Biden is flexing the federal government&#39;s power by asking the chip industry to commit to certain worker and finance promises in exchange for large subsidies. On the Brexit issue, the UK and EU struck a major trade deal affecting Northern Ireland&#39;s government and even causing friction with Washington. The Biden administration is also aiding Ukraine with high-powered advisors, more assistance, and sending Secretary Janet Yellen over to Kyiv. There&#39;s some heart wrenching hardship news too- immigrated children sent to risky and illegal jobs stateside and animals in Ukraine badly needing homes. Then Rupert Murdoch admitted Fox News hosts pushed election fraud false hoods and Biden intends to crackdown on migrant child labor exposed by uncovered Times reports. Meanwhile winter disappointed us all by finally appearing with a decent snowstorm estimated for up to 7 inches for some parts of New England. Finally, scientists are studying seismic activity in Turkey for hints about West Coast quakes and intel experts are searching for answers of Covid-19&#39;s origin.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
