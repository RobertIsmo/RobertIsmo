<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some interesting reports in the US recently. Justice Thomas and Justice Alito both requested extensions for their annual financial forms. A lieutenant in the Proud Boys group was sentenced to 17 years in prison for involvement in the Capitol attack, and President Trump pleaded not guilty in a Georgia case. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released a letter stating that he had been medically cleared to work after an episode of freezing up at a news conference, igniting speculation over his future in the Senate. In other news, authorities are investigating what caused a deadly fire in an apartment building in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the UK, Ben Wallace – an ex-soldier – has stepped down as Defense Secretary and been replaced by Grant Shapps, who is known more for his political skills rather than military experience. Lastly, tropical storms Jose and Idalia are quickly moving around Atlantic, with Jose being expected to be absorbed by Hurricane Franklin. On a lighter note, an interesting article recently came out about Dungeons &amp; Dragons players on death row in Texas – showing how this fantasy game has become a lifeline to imaginations and companionship for these men.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
