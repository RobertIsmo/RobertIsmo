<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
A lot is happening in the world right now! In the US, Supreme Court cases on student loan cancellation and the fate of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are currently being heard. In Russia, conscripts are being sent into Ukraine&#39;s lines in a new offensive. Meanwhile, Indian Americans are rapidly climbing political ranks and in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot is facing a field of challengers for her re-election run. On the global level, Afghanistan is facing a bitter winter crisis with reports of malnutrition and deaths from plunging temperatures. Lastly, scientists have discovered a lot about what happens during REM sleep - dreaming, memory-making and problem-solving!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
