<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now.  Democrats are criticizing Joe Biden for sending cluster munitions to Ukraine, while Republicans are cheering it. Questions remain about the Wagner mercenary group and what is happening in Belarus. In Ukraine, people are asking why they are still involved in conflicts. 
In the United states, the economy is doing relatively well despite some fears lingering, and Janet Yellen is in Beijing to bring up concerns about how US companies are being treated by China. The US is also raising pressure to combat fentanyl crisis working with China, and Austin Krajicek won the French Open after being close to giving up tennis. Closer to home, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has established herself on the Supreme Court quickly in her first term. Additionally, a man was sentenced for federal hate crimes for a mass shooting that happened and officials want to tear down a house related to a notorious crime scene. Lastly, six people were charged with organizing illegal donations related to NYC Mayor Eric Adam&#39;s campaign this 2021.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
