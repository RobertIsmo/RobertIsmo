<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of news in the world right now. In Israel, an investigation revealed that it has been using one of its most destructive bombs in South Gaza. In Ukraine, protesters are pushing for spending shifts due to the ongoing war. In the US, President Biden is clamping down financial firms that help Russia buy military supplies. There are also impeachment inquiries going on, and Hunter Biden&#39;s text message has been misconstrued by some Republicans as evidence of corruption. Additionally, an elderly gorilla is getting medical attention, raising questions about how much intervention is too much. On the tech front, Apple&#39;s control over messaging has been challenged by a new app and a start-up fraud has been uncovered. Governor DeSantis&#39; expensive field operation has also sputtered recently. Finally, there is a senate candidate in New Jersey whose husband is the governor, giving her an edge because of election rules.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
