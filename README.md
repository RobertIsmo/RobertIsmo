<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on in the world. In China, the Foreign Minister was removed after a month of silence, and the new Central Banker is being tested to fix a crisis. On the international scale, the IMF upgraded its global growth forecast for 2023, showing signs of resilience. Tech companies are scaling back their expansion in New York City. Big tech firms are reporting earnings which will test investors&#39; fervor for Artificial Intelligence. In terms of democracy, President Biden is taking his battle case by case. There have been mass protests in Israel over a law aimed at curbing power of the judiciary. We still don&#39;t know how Covid started exactly and why it matters. Some July heat has been identified by scientists to be virtually impossible without climate change, and we can track air quality and smoke from wildfires through maps.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
