<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, November 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy news week! In the Middle East, Russia, China, and Iran are supporting Hamas in a &quot;worldwide war of words&quot;. On the business front, Jews are viewing Fox News differently because the network is offering unwavering support for Israel in its fight against Hamas. In terms of world news, Hezbollah&#39;s leader made a high-stakes speech but failed to call for an expansion of the war. On the market side, stocks rallied while bonds reversed following several data reports and policymaker decisions. Meanwhile, many younger seniors are retiring in Florida to take advantage of a community where the average age is 79, despite some opting to be closer to their families when they retire. Natural disasters have been in focus too—a wildfire tore through Hawaii&#39;s royal capital with deadly results, while Ohio is battling over how to teach reading in schools. Finally, budget cuts are threatening the future of humanities departments across the US.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
