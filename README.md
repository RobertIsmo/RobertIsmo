<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some interesting things happening in the world right now. Businesses are looking into how they can use Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to help with college admissions essays, while federal officials have proposed new nursing home standards to help increase staffing in these places. In terms of international news, there is tension building up in Ukraine and Malawi over civil rights issues, while Maui is struggling with a huge drop in tourism due to a disasterous fire. And on a lighter note, we&#39;re finally starting to appreciate theimpact that Tammy Wynette has had on modern pop music.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
