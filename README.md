<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, November 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like abortion rights is a big issue that is helping to fuel the Democratic wins in the US elections. This is also having an effect on the talks in Congress regarding spending and avoiding a government shutdown. In terms of environmental issues, the world is still producing more oil, gas, and coal than would be safe for global heating, but environmental groups are having to cut programs because donations are shifting towards climate change. On the international stage, Hamas recently attacked Israel in an attempt to revive the Palestinian cause, while Hungary&#39;s leader Orbán&#39;s dream of an illiberal pan-European alliance is fading. Additionally, some people are opting for space burials upon death and women in Ukraine are preparing to join the army. Finally, a new law has supercharged electric car manufacturing but not sales in the US.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
