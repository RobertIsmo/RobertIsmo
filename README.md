<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, July 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To start off, there is tension building between the US and China which escalated when US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited over the weekend. President Putin in Russia is trying to reinforce his government&#39;s defenses, and a prominent Russian journalist was injured during an attack in Chechnya. Meanwhile, there are battles erupting in classrooms stages at school plays over what can be taught and performed, and many Americans are rethinking whether they will go to large public gatherings out of concerns for gun violence. July 4 celebrations this year are being adapted to more eco-friendly forms such as laser light shows due to environmental concerns, while some are taking the opportunity for political campaigning such as Mike Pence or Ron Desantis. Finally, cities across the US are facing conversion issues with piles of regulations holding them back from creating something new.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
