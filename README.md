<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot is happening in the world right now. The U.S. and China are embroiled in a risky intelligence battle to collect information on each other, while in Texas the Attorney General has been acquitted after a landmark trial that became a litmus test for loyalty to the Republican party. There are talks between the United Auto Workers and the Detroit-based automakers, and tech is causing some workers worry with the fear of having their jobs threatened by new technologies. In New York, a one-year-old boy tragically died from opioid exposure at a day care, sparking conversations about the dangers of opioids to children. Arts-wise, Rolling Stone co-founder Jann Wenner was removed from the Rock Hall Board after making controversial comments and defending his generation&#39;s legacy. At the same time, mathematicians in Ukraine were coming together to inaugurate a new center and open their science back up for the world. Finally, there was an incredible story out of Pennsylvania where one of America&#39;s most wanted fugitives managed to stay ahead of his pursuers for 13 days.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
