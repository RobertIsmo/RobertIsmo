<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of global instability and unrest at the moment. Argentina has seen prices for everyday goods like diapers skyrocket in the wake of their new president&#39;s policies. Meanwhile, military conflicts and upcoming elections threaten to disrupt economies and could cause further volatility. In Gaza, the conflict has led to a subdued Christmas in Bethlehem, while aid groups worry that a U.N. resolution may not be enough to help the region without a truce. In the U.S., Donald Trump&#39;s legal battle with special counsel Jack Smith continues, while External interference from Russia and China could play a role in the 2024 election.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
