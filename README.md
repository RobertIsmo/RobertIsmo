<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, June 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Well, the news has been pretty interesting lately. First of all, the 2024 G.O.P field is facing a difficult decision between law and order or loyalty to their former leader, President Donald Trump. Many of his supporters are using violent rhetoric to defend him against an indictment, and one of his aides has been charged as a co-conspirator in preventing government access to classified documents.

In Ukraine, they’re attempting to launch a counteroffensive against Russia, but the definitions of ‘success’ vary. Also, there was a major disaster affecting their vital lifeline when the dam at the Kakhovka Reservoir exploded and began emptying its waters. In other news, Scotland’s former leader is being arrested in a financial inquiry as well as several other party members. India also had their worst railway disaster in decades with 288 dead in crowded cars.

The Silicon Valley is also meeting with the idea that the singularity is here and AI might be going wild - or it could just be hype out of control. Lastly, Democrats are looking at a failed affirmative action campaign that could shake them up when the Supreme Court rules on college admissions by race soon - and an I-95 overpass collapsed after a tanker fire in Philadelphia that will create major delays for people&#39;s morning commutes this Monday. 

Oh yeah, and there’s an author&#x2F;sex therapist&#x2F;podcaster who wants people to think seriously about open relationships!</p>

<h3>Trump Supporters’ Violent Rhetoric in His Defense Disturbs Experts</h3>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
