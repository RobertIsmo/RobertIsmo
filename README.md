<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, February 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot going on around the world! In Ukraine, fear and tension has been heightened due to the beginning of an armed conflict over their territory. Europe is recovering from a brief energy crisis, though the aftermath from the Ukraine war continues to take its toll. In the US, a rare snowstorm has brought blizzard-like conditions to Southern California, while a winter storm in Michigan is resulting in widespread power outages. The Fed&#39;s inflation rate is continuing to remain steady and high, while in East Palestine, Ohio, an incident of train derailing has been used as fuel for political agendas. On brighter news, Bob Fosse&#39;s revival of his musical &quot;Dancin&#39;&quot; opened up on Broadway and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s new musical &quot;Bad Cinderella&quot; starring Linedy Genao and Carolee Carmello also just premiered. Lastly, New York&#39;s sick sea turtles are being taken to a special rehabilitation center to get better.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
