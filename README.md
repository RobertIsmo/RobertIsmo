<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, politicians in the US are raising a lot of questions about how the Pentagon is using funds for Ukraine. The Biden administration is also trying to strengthen US ties with Central Asian countries and prevent Russia from gaining more influence in the region. In France, a writer and filmmaker has released a movie warning of the high price the West could face if it fails to defeat Russia in Ukraine. Biden has proposed attaching conditions to $40 billion in subsidies to get businesses to behave differently, but not everyone agrees. The Supreme Court has expressed skepticism over Biden&#39;s student loan forgiveness plan due to concerns it may be outside of congressional authority. In Israel, Netanyahu is facing increasing unrest and his coalition is dealing with splits. King Charles&#39; meeting with an E.U. leader raised controversy as well, while Eugene Levy was less than enthusiastic when an offer came to host a travel show. Elsewhere, conservatives in Congress have attempted to target environmentally conscious investments, and officials at Fox News were unable to square the circle when Trump advanced ungrounded claims about election fraud. Lastly, the mayoral election in Chicago on Tuesday could have implications for other US cities dealing with similar issues linked to crime and leftover pandemic troubles.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
