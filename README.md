<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 3, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
I wanted to tell you what&#39;s been going on in the world recently. 103 people were killed in Iran in very tragic blasts near a general&#39;s tomb. The explosions occurred at a commemoration honoring his death - he was a powerful commander heading Iran’s Quds Force, and was considered a hero by some people in the country.

In economics news, America has had good news on inflation, while in the auto industry we saw a 14% jump in US car sales last year. But this also brought with it rising interest rates which are now posing a threat to sales.

On the political front, Harvard has had a shake-up after their president unexpectedly resigned due to an ongoing crisis in American academia, and their new interim president is Alan Garber, an economist and physician who criticized the university&#39;s initial response to the Israel-Hamas war. Meanwhile, the killing of Saleh al-Arouri—a key Hamas strategist—in Lebanon has set the organization back at a vulnerable time.

As for entertainment news, Oscar buzz is all over the place due to the prevalence of excellent films this year. And finally, we have a unique story out of Japan about how—despite huge flames engulfing an airplane—the crew was able to maintain order on board and evacuate 367 passengers without injury.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
