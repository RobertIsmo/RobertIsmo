<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of news involving the banking industry lately. Regulators recently shut down and seized First Republic Bank, which is now owned by JPMorgan Chase. This year has seen 3 major bank failures, which is more than in 2008. This has been the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history. As a result, people are questioning how the banking crisis has unfolded.

On the political side, independents are a crucial voting bloc in the United States, especially in Arizona where they could potentially turn away from reelecting President Joe Biden in the upcoming election. 

Internationally, Iran recently executed a former senior official who had worked as a British spy providing intelligence on nuclear and military plans. This came after conflicts between Ukraine and Russian forces, with an unusual wet ground making it hard for Ukraine to prepare a counteroffensive. 

In terms of technology, Geoffrey Hinton recently left Google and warned about potential dangers posed by A.I., while chatbots becoming increasingly popular have made it difficult to ensure users don&#39;t receive false information. 

Lastly, there was an article exploring Kyrsten Sinema&#39;s influence on American politics and her breakup with the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
