<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, February 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. President Biden recently paid an unannounced visit to Kyiv, Ukraine as a sign of resistance against President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Meanwhile, in California, members of a formerly-seized African American family have sold their land for $20 million, leading to more talks of reparations. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is currently visiting Turkey and promising to provide aid after a devastating earthquake while also attempting to diffuse tensions between the U.S. and Turkey. In Florida, Governor DeSantis visited New York on a tour meant to portray himself as tough on crime as rumors swirl about his possible presidential campaign. In Israel, protests are erupting against two bills that would reduce the power of the Supreme Court. Finally, telehealth technologies like ketamine are becoming increasingly popular treatments for mental health conditions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
