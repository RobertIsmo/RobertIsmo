<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like the country is getting in a bit of a financial pickle! The US has hit its debt limit, and the Treasury department is doing some fancy accounting moves to stop us from breaching it. People are trying to figure out what this might mean: is there an economic crash on the horizon? 

Elsewhere, Alec Baldwin is going through a legal trouble – someone died when a gun was used as a film prop on his movie set and he&#39;s been charged with involuntary manslaughter. And there’s also a case on its way to the Supreme Court that could change how social media platforms operate.

On a different note, there&#39;s a big divide between Evangelicals and former US President Donald Trump - he seems to blame them for the Republicans&#39; regrets after the midterm elections and they don&#39;t seem too pleased about it. Plus, it&#39;s being 50 years since Roe v Wade was overturned and abortion activists are discussing what happens next. Kamala Harris will be speaking in Florida soon about abortion access and contraception rights.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
