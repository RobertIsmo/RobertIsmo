<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like things have been quite busy in the news lately. The Federal Reserve is having trouble navigating a stable economy as they attempt to raise interest rates to combat inflation. Wealthy Russians are turning to Dubai as a sort of wartime harbor to begin a new life without losing ties back home. The International Criminal Court will be prosecuting Russia for abducting Ukrainian children and targeting civilian infrastructure. Films from A24 won big at the Oscars, with &#39;Everything Everywhere All at Once&#39; taking home seven awards. The Biden Administration has approved a huge Alaska oil project and reached a nuclear-powered submarine deal with Australia and Britain. The University of Pennsylvania is currently debating the tenure status of one of their professors who made racist statements. Trump and DeSantis are both visiting Davenport, Iowa for unrelated events on Monday and today Michael Cohen is testifying in front of a grand jury relating to Trump’s case.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
