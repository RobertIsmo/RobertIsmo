<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, October 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in various parts of the world. In Gaza, some people are celebrating the return of fighters while others are preparing for a potential reaction from Israel. In the US, people like Rep. Jordan are becoming more prominent figures in the Republican Party and President Biden is facing challenges with reversing some of the Trump administration&#39;s immigration policies. Additionally, Ukraine was recently hit by a missile strike that killed dozens of people, and a senator from New York has been charged with accepting bribes. Finally, there are changes being made to powerful realtor groups and President Biden&#39;s dog is under fire for biting someone!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
