<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of political and social news happening in the world right now. In the U.S., there are still ongoing debates around abortion, with both sides of the debate vowing to continue fighting while a key abortion pill remains available. There&#39;s also been a lot of discussion regarding Republicans and their struggle to deal with abortion policy since the Supreme Court decision last summer. Additionally, on the debt ceiling debate, Republicans are using it as an opportunity to push for policies related to energy policy rather than just reducing the nation&#39;s debt. 

In terms of sports news, the NFL has suspended five players for gambling violations and in terms of law, testimony has suggested that Trump was at a meeting about accessing voting software. Manhattan&#39;s district attorney has also agreed to let an ex-prosecutor testify about Trump&#39;s case in Congress. 

In other parts of the world, scientists have been letting parrots video chat with their parrot friends as radical experiment in mental health care is being tested over centuries in Belgian town Geel. 

Finally, President Biden is preparing to announce his bid for a second term but he has held fewer news conferences than other presidents like Reagan due to part of a deliberate strategy.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
