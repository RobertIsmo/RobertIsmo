<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 9, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a few major events going on in the world right now. Russia is commemorating Victory Day, albeit in a much more subdued way than usual due to ongoing tensions in Ukraine. In the U.S., President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy are meeting with congressional leaders to avert a potential default, as the country runs out of cash and has reached its debt ceiling limit. Meanwhile, Pakistan&#39;s former leader Imran Khan was arrested and his detention is causing concerns about mass protests breaking out. Lastly, there have been Israeli airstrikes against Islamic Jihad in Gaza, which has left at least 13 people dead.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
