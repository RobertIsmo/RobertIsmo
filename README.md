<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, December 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot of unrest going on in the world right now. In Ukraine, there has been a missile attack on a Russian city that has killed at least 20 people. In Israel and Gaza, there is an ongoing conflict with Hamas that is resulting in massive casualties. In the US, prosecutors are asking appeals courts to reject Trump&#39;s immunity claims and retired officers are flocking to venture capitalists that are backing defense technology startups. Additionally, Tom Wilkinson, an actor known for his roles in &#39;The Full Monty&#39; and &#39;Shakespeare in Love&#39; just passed away and 10 data points made us think deeply about the past year. Lastly, a man was also just found in Indiana who had been trapped inside the wreckage of his pickup truck for 6 days after crashing it.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
