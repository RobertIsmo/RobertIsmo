<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, May 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s quite a bit happening in the world these days! In Ukraine, they may finally be getting their requested F-16 fighter jets, which would help shore up the country&#39;s air force. Russia has recently announced new sanctions on U.S. officials, many of whom clashed with former President Donald Trump. There&#39;s also been some talk about the need for new agreements and arrangements to secure minerals for electric cars, as countries around the world are competing for them. In Japan, there&#39;s increased focus on gay rights thanks to U.S. ambassador Rahm Emanuel, who is pushing for greater equality despite opposition from Japanese conservatives. Then there are those who have sought refuge from Afghanistan, crossing jungles in search of safety after the U.S. left them behind. Meanwhile, at home the Biden administration is debating ways to raise the debt limit and speaking out on behalf of Black Republicans like South Carolina Senator Tim Scott who are running for president—even as Florida Governor DeSantis skips discussing his restrictive ban on abortions in order to attract support from across party lines! And if you&#39;re into travel and tourist hotspots, have you heard about Zibo in China? It has become famous for its barbecue style and is being overrun with visitors! Finally, hotels everywhere are rolling out all sorts of amenities and services for pet owners who now travel more often with their four-legged friends.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
