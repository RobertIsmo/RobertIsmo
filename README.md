<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. China is increasingly militarizing its waters, creating an intimidating coast guard to assert its power in Asia. There&#39;s a growing problem with fentanyl drug use in New York, and how to deal with it has become a contentious issue. In Moldova, a fraudster has seized an ethnic enclave there to further his own plans. Ukraine is attempting to revive exports across the Black Sea despite Russian threats. NASA just collected regolith from an asteroid which may provide knowledge about our solar system and life. Ron DeSantis was accused of mistreating Guantanamo detainees but The New York Times found no evidence to back this up. He is now trying to take control of North Carolina&#39;s election boards and transform a public college into a bastion of conservatism. In Mexico, people are battling cartels trying to find missing loved ones. Finally, the number of women in the NFL has been increasing and they have formed their own support systems.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
