<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the U.S., President Biden is seeking to deter Iran and Hezbollah, and former President Trump is dealing with a federal election case after making some threatening statements. Around the world, Israel is bracing for a deeper war amid a crisis of trust in the government, and major earthquakes have struck Afghanistan multiple times in recent weeks claiming over 1,000 lives. In Nepal, China has invested in expensive infrastructure, which has left Nepal with lots of debt. Meanwhile, a climate advocacy group is spending 80 million dollars on ads to help boost Biden&#39;s environmental record. Finally, in New Orleans, there are amazing restaurants to try out!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
