<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. The Supreme Court is issuing a temporary stay that will preserve the availability of abortion pills in the US. In Brazil, their president is trying to rebuild ties with China and seeking to bring peace in Ukraine. President Biden is visiting Ireland and finding his own family roots there. Mike Pompeo said he won&#39;t run for president in 2024, but other current and potential candidates are speaking at an NRA meeting on gun rights. Finally, there was a tech executive who prosecutors say was murdered after an argument with someone he knew.</p>

<h3>Supreme Court Briefly Preserves Broad Availability of Abortion Pill</h3>
<sub>By Adam Liptak</sub>
<p>The temporary stay is meant to preserve the status quo while the justices study lower court rulings, and it did not forecast how they would ultimately rule.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3mB6byW"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Abortion Pills, the Latest Battleground, Have Been Little Known to Americans</h3>
<sub>By Ruth Igielnik and Andrew Fischer</sub>
<p>A majority of Americans had not heard of mifepristone, a survey earlier this year found. The drug is now at the center of an abortion case headed to the Supreme Court.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3ogPadD"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Airman Charged in Leak of Classified Documents</h3>

<p>Jack Teixeira, 21, was granted a top-secret security clearance in 2021, which was required for his job, the Justice Department complaint said.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43DklQW"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<h3>Teixeira’s case is unusual even in the small world of leak cases.</h3>
<sub>By Charlie Savage</sub>
<p>Based on the charging documents, Airman Jack Teixeira does not appear to have been acting as a foreign agent, differentiating him from classic spying cases. He also does not appear to have been acting as a whistle-blower.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/43vXRB3"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
