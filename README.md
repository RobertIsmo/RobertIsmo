<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, August 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now! In the US, there&#39;s a 38-year-old Republican candidate for office named Vivek Ramaswamy who&#39;s trying to appeal to younger voters, but is making some inaccurate claims along the way. There&#39;s also been a Republican presidential debate, and Oliver Anthony, the singer of a hit song called &quot;Rich Men North of Richmond,&quot; is pushing back against its being mistaken for a Republican anthem. 

In terms of international news, there have been some headlines coming out of China recently concerning their economy and potential impacts on the US. Meanwhile, FIFA has suspended Spanish soccer federation chief involved in post-game kiss due to the fallout it created over perceived sexism. 

Ukraine is in the news with news of Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner private militia, whose presumed death was just reported this week - with many residents not feeling any sorrow for him. The Ukrainian commander has also been calling for more defenses in northeast Ukraine as Russia continues to push forward with plans to take more territory there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
