<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of news stories to keep track of right now. In the US, Donald Trump is coasting ahead of the Iowa caucuses, while former Governor Nikki Haley and current Governor Ron DeSantis are clashing. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is having trouble connecting with young voters. On another front, police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of three Palestinian students in Vermont. In other international news, there have been several hostages released, including a 4-year-old Israeli-American girl and a Russian-Israeli man. And in Russia, women are protesting against long deployments for soldiers in Ukraine. 

At home, former President Trump&#39;s pardon of a drug smuggler is raising some eyebrows - though it may be related to the Kushners. On the environment front, Biden will not be attending the UN Climate Summit. Finally, car crash victims in New York are seeking justice through a new approach - talking to drivers directly about taking responsibility for their actions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
