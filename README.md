<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, news has been breaking about former President Trump and some of his associates facing legal issues. In Alton, New Hampshire, one of Trump&#39;s strongholds, some people are still loyal to him but worry that he may not be successful in the general election. Additionally, in Georgia, there were attempts by Trump and his allies to reverse the election outcome--though with no success. 

On a separate note, a U.S. court ruled in favor of some Montana youths in a landmark climate case, giving them the right to have a healthful environment and forcing regulators to take climate impact into account.

Meanwhile, on Maui island in Hawaii, a wildfire destroyed homes and the water system there collapsed as the inferno spread. 

Back on the mainland, Hunter Biden reported that prosecutors had reneged on part of the plea deal he had made with them. Separately FBI counterintelligence leader Charles McGonigal is under federal investigation for taking bribes. 

On a more uplifting note, Thai Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard shared his three rules for life after being dubbed &quot;the world’s happiest man”. 

Lastly, in Russia we&#39;re hearing accounts from Russian soldiers who have faced disregard from their commanders--in some cases leading to fatal outcomes--and have been pressurized into re-enlisting.
 
That&#39;s just some of what&#39;s been happening recently!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
