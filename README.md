<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, November 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, in the world around us, hospitals in Gaza City have been caught in a deadly crossfire as Hamas fighters and Israeli forces battle for territory. There&#39;s also reports coming out of the Gaza Strip of tunnels that are used by Hamas fighters to avoid detection and smuggle weapons around. Meanwhile, universities here in the United States such as Harvard, Columbia and Penn have pledged to confront antisemitism on their campuses. Over in New York, the FBI has seized Eric Adams&#39; phones after a raid at one of his chief fundraiser&#39;s home while his own 25-year old fund-raising chief has been placed under the spotlight. Elsewhere in US news, Democrats are finding it harder to hold on the Senate after Senator Manchin pulled out and Louisiana is mandated by federal appeals court to finalize a new voting map by January 2021. San Francisco is also scrambling to get everything cleaned up before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference next month, while Treasury secretary Janet Yellen is advocating for a &#39;healthy&#39; economic ties between China and the US. Lastly, some are even opting to send their remains into space as their final wish when they pass on. Finally recently, Pastor Stephen C. Lee who was indicted alongside Donald Trump for civil fraud has asked for evangelical supporters to come help him out, leading Republicans to launch an attack against the judge who preside over Donald Trump&#39;s trial.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
