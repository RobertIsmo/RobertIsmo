<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, the Supreme Court ruled on a few important cases: they decided that the Biden administration overstepped their authority with student loan cancellation and the Colorado website maker did not have to make wedding websites celebrating same-sex marriages. This could lead to college admissions becoming more subjective and affirmative action policies ending in universities which could have an effect on corporate diversity.

A heatwave is affecting the south, southwest, and Midwest causing smoky conditions. In Ukraine, Russia destroyed a town and only 1,700 people remain.

A nationwide dispute has broken out related to pickleball noise leading to petitions, calls to police, and even lawsuits. Alan Arkin passed away recently at the age of 89; he was known for his comedic roles but also had a flair for drama.

In France, police are now allowed to shoot at drivers without training which has resulted in an increase of fatal shootings. This has incited angry protests.</p>

<h3>With Supreme Court Decision, College Admissions Could Become More Subjective</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
