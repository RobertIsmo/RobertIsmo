<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, December 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is currently a big news story on the US Capitol riot and former President Donald Trump&#39;s alleged involvement. This week, members of Congress released a final report on their inquiry into the incident, as well as testimony from a witness who claims to have been approached by someone close to Trump to focus on protecting him. There&#39;s also a report that shows how the IRS funds were misused for Trump&#39;s audits.

Outside of the US, there is plenty of news too. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was recently in the US, where his trip to Washington was largely unsuccessful in getting the country more weapons. However, he received a hero&#39;s welcome when he returned home. There are also reports of a Russian military unit being tracked in Ukraine following an attack that killed dozens.

In other news, there is the latest on disgraced cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried who is out on $250 million bond with restrictions after his extradition from the Bahamas. The SEC Chair has also given comments about new crypto laws not being needed at this time. Lastly, there was an interesting display of bipartisanship in the Senate where two groups managed to come together and pass an $1.7 trillion spending bill which includes nearly $50 billion in aid for Ukraine.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
