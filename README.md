<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the US, Republican Senator Tuberville has agreed to lift a blockade on the promotion of most military personnel after pressure from both parties. There&#39;s also a vote being planned on an impeachment inquiry that is expected to have unanimous Republican support. The US is also denying visas to violent Israeli settlers and some West Bank Palestinians in response to rising acts of violence there.

In China, President Xi Jinping has tightened control of finance with a new ideological framework that places primacy of his leadership and Marxist principles. Former US Ambassador Nikki Haley is getting criticism for her role in the Trump administration, but is now receiving support from top Democratic donor Reid Hoffman who has devoted $250,000 to a super PAC. Liz Cheney, who was formerly in Congress, is rumored to possibly run for president in 2024 with the aim of preventing Trump from returning to office. 

Meanwhile, federal prosecutors are preparing to use Trump&#39;s trial on charges relating to overturning the 2020 election to demonstrate his long-term pattern of making baseless threats and claims. There has been an A.I. arms race in Silicon Valley which was triggered by ChatGPT&#39;s release last year, while at the Supreme Court Justices appeared skeptical of a challenge to a tax provision from the Trump-era. Ultimately this could lead to changes in the US tax code if they rule against it. Additionally, there&#39;s an interesting story about podcasters involved in an investigation into a murder case involving a victim&#39;s family and how it highlighted emotional minefields for them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
