<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world. In the US, former President Trump is facing new charges relating to documents and security camera footage allegedly being deleted from his Mar-a-Lago property. Meanwhile, revelations about how he stored classified documents at the same location are coming to light. Elsewhere, the Senate has passed a defense bill and the House a spending bill, though there are tensions between both on money and policy. But funding issues remain in play and could lead to a potential government shutdown later this year. On the international front, Ukraine is pushing forward an assault against Russia but keeping its intentions fairly obscure. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin is attempting to shore up ties with African nations by offering free grain, though with mixed success. Finally, a judge in Delaware drew attention to herself after refusing to act as a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for Hunter Biden&#39;s case.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
