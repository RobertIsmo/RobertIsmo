<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, September 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. Putin had a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un that could lead to an improved relationship between the two countries. At the same time, there is ongoing fighting in Ukraine and an earthquake just struck Morocco. In the U.S., there are two new Covid-19 vaccines that have been approved and conspiracy theorists are capitalizing on the recent increase in cases of the virus. New Yorkers have seen a surge in child care costs, so much so that even upper-middle-class people have difficulty affording it, and Republicans are hoping to take control of Virginia&#39;s state government this fall. Apple is set to release a new iPhone soon, meaning that their share of smartphone sales will increase even more. On top of all that, today marks 22 years since 9&#x2F;11 and people have paid their respects at Ground Zero in NYC.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
