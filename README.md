<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

There is a lot going on in the world right now. For example, tech mogul Elon Musk is making moves to cut costs at Twitter, and Kevin McCarthy&#39;s bid for Speaker of the House has been thrown into turmoil because of a group of conservative detractors. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have accused two US nationals and five Russians of conspiring to provide military-grade technology to Russia, and Ukraine appears to be launching a southern offensive against the city of Melitopol. There is also news relating to sports - Lionel Messi seems to be defying age and his opponents in soccer games with a little help from his friends, while Morocco is getting ready to face France in a World Cup match with implications that span more than just the sport. Finally, President Biden recently signed a bill into law designed to protect same-sex marriage rights across the country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
