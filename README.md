<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To my friend: 
There is a lot of news happening around the world right now that&#39;s worth catching up on. In the US, President Biden just forged a new strategic partnership with Vietnam in light of increasing regional competition from China. Tennis has had a lot of action with Coco Gauff winning at the U.S. Open and making history. There&#39;s also this incredible story out of Missouri about a nun whose remains haven&#39;t decomposed - quite mysterious! Besides these stories, our president is still dealing with the political danger surrounding his son Hunter, and Florida governor DeSantis is trying to maintain distance from Donald Trump while managing their state&#39;s Covid response. On the global front, Spain&#39;s top soccer official recently resigned over an inappropriate kiss incident and prosecutors have opened an investigation against him. Meanwhile we have Viktor Bout, aka the &quot;merchant of death,&quot; makinig moves in politics, and a Chinese singer that received backlash for performing at a bombed-out theater in Ukraine. All that in one day!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
