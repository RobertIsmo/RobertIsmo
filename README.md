<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot happening in the US, both politically and economically. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon is using Republican Party dysfunction as a way to build his own following and that of some right-wing House rebels. Two Congressmen, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio, recently announced bids to become Speaker of the House after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. Nancy Pelosi was kicked out of a bonus office because she didn&#39;t support McCarthy. Joe Biden has just canceled another $9 billion of student loan debt, after a three-year pause on payments resumed earlier this month.

Outside the US, Haiti is struggling with gang violence and is bringing in police officers from Kenya to help restore order, despite claims of brutality in their own country. In New York, police tracked down a missing 9-year-old girl through a ransom note and fingerprint evidence. Giuliani&#39;s drinkign is the subject of much attention in the wake of Donald Trump&#39;s federal case over 2020 election interference. Trump himself is involved in civil fraud trial which may cost him $250 million if he loses out.

Florida Governor DeSantis received a financial boost recently and has moved some staff to Iowa as he looks for reelection. On the healthcare front, Kaiser Permanente employees have gone on strike after disagreements with their management over contracts. Finally, Yiyun Li has shared a story by Amy Bloom about the power of love with her writing students for 12 years as a way to remind them about hope in the face of difficulties.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
