<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, April 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To sum it up, there is a lot going on in the world right now. In the military, a young National Guard airman is facing some serious accusations of giving out classified documents to an online war games group. The Biden administration has just asked the Supreme Court to restore access to the most commonly used abortion pill in the US. It turns out many Americans had not heard of this drug before it became such a hot topic. Meanwhile, economists are discussing if a recession is headed our way despite good economic numbers, and big banks are reporting bumper profits. In international news, China is being pressured to offer debt relief to poor countries and Ghost from the past still roam the Chernobyl nuclear wasteland. Finally, when it comes to climate changing technology, we need to plug in many cars, trucks, heaters and factories for this change and in China, domestic car companies are selling more vehicles than foreign ones. In rural Texas there is an interesting rise of support for public schools even though many other parts of the US have been trying to move away from them in favour of private schools.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
