<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. The U.S. is boosting their military role in the Philippines to counter China&#39;s influence, and Europe has banned Russian diesel exports as an embargo. Meanwhile, mortgage rates have decreased which has led to some home buyers returning to the market. At the same time, many are buying chickens due to egg inflation and there are discussions around a trillion-dollar coin to avoid debt-ceiling issues. The Bank of England just raised its rates to 4% and Shell reported enormous profits of $42 billion last year. Lastly, U.S. Ambassador David Pressman is facing opposition in Hungary while young women are carving out a space of their own with a skateboarding collective in Nigeria.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
