<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on in the world right now. U.S. Secretary of State Blinken is in Finland, detailing Russia’s &#39;failures&#39;. In the US, there was a debt-limit deal that suggests the US debt will keep growing quickly. It also staved off a calamitous default. President Biden is giving an Oval Office address to talk about the legislation. There’s also been a lot of legal action on former President Trump and his documents inquiry, as well as Pence not facing any charges in the same inquiry. On an economic level, job growth still remains strong despite some economic clouds and the Federal Reserve may still choose to hold off on an interest rate increase at its June 13-14 meeting. In terms of more localized news, there’s a debate about a Dollar General opening in a rural crossroads, as well as issues with power and water in Guam after Typhoon Mawar knocked out much of their infrastructure. Finally, Saudi Arabia is creating a huge fund to sign big-name soccer stars from around the world.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
