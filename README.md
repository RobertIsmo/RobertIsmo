<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, September 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot going on in the world. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner mercenary group, has recently passed away and a big fight for his empire is starting in three countries. Elon Musk has acknowledged withholding satellite service to Ukraine to prevent an attack. At the G20 meeting, US President Biden is trying to get other countries to take his side on issues like Ukraine and China&#39;s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. 

Also, Duke University has very few low-income students so this case is getting studied by colleges with economic diversity. The US Open semi-finals were stopped due to environmental protesters and now Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka will be playing the finals. In Pennsylvania, prison officials are investigating why Danelo Cavalcante was able to escape and Trump&#39;s election interference report will soon be released in Georgia. Lastly, Peter Navarro who was a top adviser of former president Trump was charged with contempt of Congress for defying House investigation. Additionally, Hong Kong and other Southern Chinese cities have recently been flooded by rainstorms from Typhoon Haikui.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
