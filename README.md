<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, March 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>Well, in China, Xi Jinping has just been re-elected for an unprecedented third term as president. This solidifies his grip on power in the country and will have lasting repercussions for them. Meanwhile, here in the US, Joe Biden has just released his budget but is yet to address how he plans to fix Social Security like he promised during his 2020 campaign. Elsewhere, jobs data is due which could provide a strong indication of the economic health of the country. Finally, Asian actors are getting more recognition with a few receiving Oscar nominations this year - something which unfortunately hasn&#39;t been seen too much historically.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
