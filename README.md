<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, Texas has just passed a controversial law allowing state authorities to arrest migrants crossing the border. Meanwhile, Congress is negotiating on an aid bill to Ukraine, but has yet to reach an agreement. Over in Israel, there&#39;s been a shift to the right in politics, and in Iceland a volcano has recently erupted after weeks of warnings. In entertainment news, actor Jonathan Majors has been dropped by Marvel after being convicted of assault against his girlfriend. Meanwhile, tech giant Google is paying out $700 million in a settlement with states over antitrust issues and allowing more payment options for app makers. Over in China, a enormous earthquake struck Gansu province killing over 100 people and leaving survivors facing subzero temperatures. Lastly, there&#39;s been increased attention to dentists and lactation consultants pushing tongue-tie releases to mothers struggling with breastfeeding. Finally, at home federal appeals judges have unanimously rejected Mark Meadows&#39;s request to transfer Georgia&#39;s state election interference case against Donald Trump to federal court.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
