<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 19, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of political developments around the world recently. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is meeting with Xi Jinping, the leader of China, in an attempt to mitigate tensions between the two countries while Germany and China work to reset their relations after an pause due to the pandemic. In the U.S., Republican leaders are embracing early voting but at odds with former President Donald Trump who opposes it. There are also recent news about Russia trying to kill a CIA spy in Florida and a failed plot in Ukraine to arm themselves with weapons that turned out to be unusable or too broken to use. Lastly, in Argentina inflation has passed the 100% mark, where people are rushing to spend pesos before they become worthless, while their restaurant scene is thriving unexpectedly.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
