<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 25, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In Ukraine, air raid sirens sounded across the entire country on Christmas morning due to an expected wave of missile attacks from Russia. Also in Russia, their mercenaries have gained control of the Central African Republic and caused concern among Western countries. In the US, a harsh winter storm has left Buffalo and its surrounding area reeling. Con Edison has even asked New Yorkers to conserve energy to help. Canada has been hit with a strong storm too and thousands are without power there. This election year may have scared some citizens but ultimately resulted in the rejection of extremists by a narrow majority. Kari Lake, a Republican candidate for Arizona governor, recently had her effort to overturn her election loss rejected by an Arizona judge. China is helping lonely single people over 50 find love through game shows. And finally, the Taliban has barred women from participating with NGOs which could worsen their current crisis.</p>

<h3>How the Worst Fears for Democracy Were Averted in 2022</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
