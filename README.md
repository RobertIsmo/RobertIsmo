<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on right now in the world. The US Senate recently passed a debt limit bill to avoid an economic calamity and President Biden will be delivering an Oval Office address about it soon. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve may possibly skip a June interest rate increase even though there has been strong hiring news. Over in China, investors have become less optimistic about their economy and its recovery from the pandemic. In the oil market, OPEC Plus is considering making further production cuts because of falling prices. 

Things are also tense in Ukraine at the moment, with pregnant women facing tough trials due to the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. As for North Korea, tensions are rising due to reports that it has made significant progress on its nuclear programs. Closer to home, people in rural areas are debating whether chain stores like Dollar General should be built there or not. 

Finally, people are paying attention to Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi who is in jail but continues advocating for freedom despite her circumstances. And recently a recording of former President Donald Trump discussing not being able to declassify a sensitive document has raised questions regarding a defense he made for himself.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
