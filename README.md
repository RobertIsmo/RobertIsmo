<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Lots of businesses are starting to reopen in China, but foreign companies there are feeling uneasy about the government&#39;s increased focus on controlling what companies say about markets and other businesses. In addition, Chinese censors are removing videos about poverty from the internet and the news media, despite the president&#39;s claims that he has succeeded in ending it. 

In Montana, one family is responsible for the state&#39;s conservative shift, and even some Republicans are cautious. In Turkey, wealthy families got rich off of a corrupt construction system which collapsed during an earthquake recently. Also, luxury fashion is being turned upside down as almost nobody can tell the difference between expensive designer handbags and knockoffs that cost a fraction of the price.

Investment banks and regulators are struggling right now with figuring out how to keep stock market troubles from spilling into day-to-day business operations. HSBC is torn between keeping its Asian division or staying based in Britain while Russian officials are alleging that a drone attack was aimed at killing the President--something Ukraine denies.

The British economy could be bumped up with King Charles&#39; coronation over the weekend, while municipalities across England will have citizens voting today in areas influential to future national elections. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson wrote a book on whiteness and civil violations like littering or idling could also be subject to sliding-scale fines if proposed City Council legislation passes.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
