<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, March 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. Former President Donald Trump is facing multiple investigations and a grand jury, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel is juggling far-right political agendas and public anger over judicial changes. In Mexico, an immigration center fire has killed at least 39 migrants near the U.S. border, highlighting the plight of those stranded away from home because of the United States&#39; strict immigration policies. Meanwhile, President Biden is taking steps to strengthen democracies around the world, yet some countries are still struggling with political turmoil. On thetechnology front, artificial intelligence (A.I.) is becoming more advanced and its use for political emails and other purposes is blurring the line between fact and fiction. This raises questions about whether A.I. could make certain white-collar jobs obsolete or if it would help increase productivity.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
