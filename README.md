<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot happening around the world. In the US, officials have said that a Russian general knew about plans for a rebellion led by the head of Wagner, a mercenary group. In Ukraine, there is currently an intense battle taking place over terrain that is proving difficult to overcome. In Canada, ongoing wildfires are impacting air quality as far away as Europe and North America. Unsurprisingly, climate change has been linked to increasing temperatures and dryness which worsen these conditions. Texas is experiencing increased political control from the Republicans who have passed laws pre-empting local labor rules. Moreover, most of the South is facing extreme heat due to dangerous heatwaves. With regards to technology, artificial intelligence is being increasingly used among British merchants to combat shoplifting with its improved accuracy. However, it has been revealed that this technology has flaws which could potentially be exploited. Scientists have also discovered that our planet&#39;s axis of rotation shifted dramatically in the early 2000s, connected to human-caused factors such as climate change and pollution. Lastly, China is currently struggling economically and some employers now deem workers over 35 years old to be undesirable job prospectives. To reverse this decline, Beijing hopes to reassert its global prominence by exporting goods abroad.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
