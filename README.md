<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s been some tragic violence over the past few days. A 26-year-old hero disarmed a mass shooter in the US, but unfortunately one couple on the dance floor was affected by the attack. In Ukraine, their leader is urging all Ukrainians to stay unified, and in Spain, reports show Russian agents may have directed a far-right group to carry out mail bombs. China has also been expanding its power in the Solomon Islands, which has been met with some resentment. On a lighter note, Lisa Marie Presley was given a royal tribute at Graceland and an accused terrorist was apprehended by the NYPD in New York. Joe Biden&#39;s lawyers made a mistake in assuming official files would be kept in a think tank, and a reporter whose tenacity often earned her scorn from Hollywood bigwigs was remembered by those who knew her best. Finally, football fans watched Damar Hamlin, who had collapsed during the team&#39;s last meeting, come together with his teammates for their divisional round game.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
