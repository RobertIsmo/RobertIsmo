<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot going on in the world right now. In US news, former president Donald Trump&#39;s former lawyer Michael Cohen denounced him in court recently, and Tom Emmer dropped his bid for House GOP Speaker after getting backlash from right-wing colleagues. On the international front, there&#39;s fighting between Israel and Hamas, with reports of elderly Israelis being held captive by Hamas in Jordanian tunnels. Ukraine is also facing intense fighting, with the government ordering evacuations of children from villages near the front lines. Canada has had a rough year due to wild fires that have burned 45 million acres. There&#39;s also news in technology: Microsoft has made an AI investment to stabilize their cloud business and Alphabet (which owns Google) reported a strong 11% increase in sales yet has disappointed in its cloud business.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
