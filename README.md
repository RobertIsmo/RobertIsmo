<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot recently happening in the world that&#39;s of concern. In Gaza City, hospitals are facing impossible choices and war looms as trust in the Israeli government breaks down. In Nepal, China has made a big contract but locals are paying the price due to debt and pricey infrastructure projects. In West Virginia, &#39;Big Jim&#39; Justice is running for Senate. On the international side, Africa and Asia are facing a desperate hunger due to a fertilizer shortage and 131 people in Texas almost died because of lapses in air traffic control. Closer to home, Republican candidates DeSantis and Haley have different viewpoints when it comes to helping Gaza refugees and President Biden&#39;s 2024 filings show his overall financial strength. Lastly, people are examining the American Museum of Natural History&#39;s practices from the 1940s in collecting human remains and often being viewed as abusive and racist.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
