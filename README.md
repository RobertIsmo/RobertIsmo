<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, January 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot of political turmoil in the US right now. The Republicans and Democrats are in a debt stand-off, with the Republicans refusing to say what specific spending cuts they want made. And now Joe Biden has gone one step further and is demanding details on budget cuts from Republican leader McCarthy. On top of this, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin is trying to broker a compromise to raise the debt ceiling.

Outside politics, it&#39;s not looking much better. In Ukraine, international tensions have resulted in more dangerous conditions for people who work in the sex trade, and Black Americans are more likely to face tax audits from the IRS due to discrimination. There is also a trend of Black families leaving New York City due to rising living costs.

On a brighter note, there are some fascinating scientific breakthroughs: like how dolphins that worked as mine-hunters in their youth are at the forefront of marine mammal medicine, and how a new survey reveals an often violent final ritual done by ancient bog bodies.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
