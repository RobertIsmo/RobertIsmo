<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In Israel, some troops are being withdrawn from Gaza. In Gaza, the UN is warning that half of the population is at risk of starving, and in Japan, there has been an earthquake. Here in the US, we have a lot of new state laws taking effect on hot-button issues as well as a court ruling allowing a gun ban in most public places to take effect. Additionally, Donald Trump is making an ambitious attempt to gain &#39;absolute immunity&#39; from future prosecution. Lastly, there was an amazing demonstration of love in Moscow when two young people were married in a prison.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
