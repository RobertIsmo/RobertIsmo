<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, October 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! For starters, President Biden is currently facing risks during his visit to the Middle East, while Secretary of State Blinken is running from one country to another trying to negotiate the complex diplomatic crisis. In China, President Xi Jinping is rethinking his $1 trillion signature aid initiative which was meant to increase their global influence. In the US, Ohio Republican Jordan inches closer to becoming House Speaker even if some Republican holdouts remain. Here in America, we&#39;re all still trying to understand how long-term Covid will affect us and Harvard is even getting involved by using TikTok influencers to spread awareness. Finally, environmental concerns about fish farming are driving some New York condo residents to make changes for the better and Justice Barrett wants the Supreme Court to adopt an ethics code for greater public transparency.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
