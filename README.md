<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, September 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, top Democrats are rallying behind President Biden&#39;s re-election bid but many voters are worried about it. Former President Trump recently criticized Florida Governor DeSantis&#39;s abortion ban. A new White House Counsel had to settle in quickly since Speaker Kevin McCarthy opened an impeachment inquiry into President Biden shortly after taking office. The US and China are also ramping up their global spy operations. 

Sports is a hot topic too, with many celebrating young tennis star Coco Gauff’s rise to success as a female athlete. Around the world, South Korea is facing its painful past as it grapples with a corrupt adoption system that led to it becoming the world&#39;s largest &#39;baby exporter.&#39; Wall Street investors in the US are reshaping home ownership in some areas, squeezing out first-time buyers and causing disruption for local communities. There are still court cases going on related to issues such as sexual assault and false accusations – with one at Yale exposing the accused to a defamation lawsuit. Two people have been charged with murder in relation to the death of a 1-year-old at a daycare center, believed to be due to opioid exposure. On top of this, Speaker McCarthy is trying to break an economic impasse by introducing legislation related to military funding. Finally, climate protesters took to the streets of New York City for big march ahead of U.N. meetings this week calling for an end to fossil fuels, while California Governor Newsom is preparing to sign a landmark climate disclosure bill that could have national repercussions.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
