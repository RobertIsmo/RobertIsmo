<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, December 24, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world today! In the US, former president Donald Trump is trying to get a court case related to his immunity from prosecution dismissed. Meanwhile, in Gaza, despite a UN resolution, aid groups are still saying that there won&#39;t be enough of an improvement without an official cease-fire agreement. In Ukraine, Russia has recently hinted that it might accept a cease-fire with Ukraine too while simultaneously Ukraine has accused one of its own defense officials of stealing $40 million. Additionally, in Yemen, Houthi militia have been attacking commercial ships the Red Sea and in Mexico, archaeologists are uncovering the centuries old secrets of catacombs hidden beneath the ruins of Mitla. Lastly, many high-profile public figures such as former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#39;Connor and musician Tony Bennett have passed away this year.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
