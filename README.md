<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, May 17, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it looks like the world is facing a lot of challenges. For starters, heat is projected to rise to record levels in the next five years, with major consequences for health, food security, and the environment. Canada is trying to grapple with devastating wildfires that are also impacting their oil and gas industry. Italy has cancelled a major race because of severe flooding. 

The US is currently dealing with major debt concerns--President Biden was confident they would not default and has named negotiators to talk with Republicans about a deal to raise the debt ceiling. Additionally, Ukrainians are seeing possible gains in a key battle area that may mark a shift in momentum in the conflict there. 

And then there are less serious but still noteworthy things happening. Indonesia&#39;s president is responding to an unsustainable future by moving the capital city and comedians are finding humor in grief. Finally, Florida Governor DeSantis is making moves in anticipation of his 2024 presidential campaign, meanwhile a study suggests that humans evolved all over Africa at different times and places.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
