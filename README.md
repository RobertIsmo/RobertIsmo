<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, October 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of tensions in the Middle East due to Hamas attacks. Iran, which is a longtime supporter of Hamas, has been under scrutiny for possibly playing a direct role in the assault. In response, Israel&#39;s security services have been failing to stop these attacks, leading to an increase in violence, terror and civilian casualties. In China, the country is at risk for further ramifications from this conflict due to its heavy reliance on imported oil from Saudi Arabia and Iran. Meanwhile in the US, Harvard students have blamed Israel for the violence, with former president Lawrence Summers condemning the leadership who have not spoken up. Also, in South Carolina Nancy Mace is taking on attempts to make her district redder as it starts to become more conservative. Additionally, air trafic control issues have come up recently when 131 people were almost killed due to two planes being seconds away from crashing into each other in Texas. Moving over to hip-hop culture, there is an Olympic moment happening right now that has left its originators feeling left out and wondering if their art will translate into sport. Lastly, Jamaica is seeing a push for making its Patois language official and cutting ties with the British monarchy due to fraying relationships.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
