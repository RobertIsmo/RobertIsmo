<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 11, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a couple of fires burning in Hawaii that have been contained but search effort is underway to make sure there are no casualties. In the US, former president Donald Trump is facing a cash crunch due to legal bills piled up against him. Meanwhile, a trial related to his alleged election interference is due soon. A collective in London called Looty is reclaiming items from Western museums to give people from former colonies a chance to learn about their stolen heritage. There are also fears of a second Russian occupation in Ukraine as Moscow troops advance closeby. And here at home, our beaches were shattered after an expensive repair project only to be wrecked by a single storm. There are some sports news as well – Sweden is out from the World Cup ensuring that first-time champion will take home the trophy and Spain has reached its first Women&#39;s World Cup semifinal.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
