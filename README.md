<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, September 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of things happening in the world right now. In the US, the former leader of the Proud Boys has been sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. Another man, who founded a failed cryptocurrency exchange, is facing fraud charges and is protesting his conditions in jail. Meanwhile, bankruptcy lawyers have made a fortune from five crypto companies that have declared bankruptcy. 

In Ukraine, there is an ongoing battle with Russia as forces try to punch a hole through Russian lines. And in the US, there is a manhunt for a Pennsylvania fugitive who escaped from a prison after being sentenced to life for murder, while lawyers are seeking a new trial for South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaughwho was convicted of murder. 

Closer to home, Americans are starting to lose faith in the value of college and high tuition rates may be to blame. In Colorado, there has been a long dispute over water rights which has finally come to fruition. And Texans are facing impeachment charges brought against their attorney general by fellow Republicans. 

Finally, scientists have discovered the remains of a child suspected of being a revenant (undead creature) from around 400 years ago when Europeans believed that corpses could rise from their graves!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
