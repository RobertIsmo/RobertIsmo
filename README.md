<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, August 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been some really devastating events happening around the world lately. On Maui, there was a huge fire that caused unfortunate destruction and loss of life. In response, medical teams from Honolulu airlifted the most critically injured survivors to receive treatment at a burn unit. 

The political atmosphere in the US has also been tense. There&#39;s an ongoing investigation of Donald Trump by Georgia prosecutors and the Special Counsel recently obtained access to his private Twitter messages. On top of this, the former president&#39;s lawyer just resigned from his case.

In Russia, their economy is facing hardship due to a war with Ukraine, causing them to increase interest rates drastically to manage inflation and pay for the war. Meanwhile, in China, the world&#39;s biggest real estate developer is on the brink of default which could cause some serious economic damage there too.

On a lighter note, movie fans on TikTok get to review movies for an audience of millions – all without being called &#39;critics&#39;. And finally, a woman in Texas just won $1.2 billion in a civil lawsuit regarding revenge porn which shows that justice still prevails!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
