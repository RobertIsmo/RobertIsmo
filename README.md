<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, April 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is in a bit of an upheaval right now. In France, President Macron&#39;s visit to China has caused quite a stir, with many of his allies objecting to the cozying up he did with Beijing. Russia made it even harder to avoid military service - barring those called up to fight in Ukraine from leaving the country. That&#39;s not even mentioning the bombshell circumstances laid out in a leaked document that suggests a possible president power struggle between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. 

On our shores, the Biden Administration is proposing cuts to water allotments from the Colorado River as it dries up. Meanwhile, an online meme group has been responsible for spreading military secrets - leading to acknowledgement of the breach by Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken in talks with Ukrainian officials. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is also wrapped up in some controversy over his relationship with billionaire Harlan Crow and calls for an ethics code for justices have intensified in light of it all. A gunman who killed five people near Louisville left a note behind detailing his motives, and out west in California, tech companies including Uber are laying off employees and causing trouble to ripple through other industries; what was once a $100 billion surplus has plummeted into a deficit due to decreased profits from those industries. Lastly, photographer Kwame Brathwaite passed away; he was part of the &#39;black is beautiful&#39; movement during civil rights-era and used his photographs to capture black pride among athletes, musicians, models and everyday people alike.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
