<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In Israel, there are widespread protests as people demonstrate against the government. Meanwhile in Ukraine, locals have set out to rebuild a colossal Mriya cargo plane that was destroyed last year during military conflict. Closer to home, the mayoral race in Chicago is being heavily influenced by unions - specifically, the teachers and police unions. In California&#39;s Central Valley, farmers and emergency crews are in a scramble to save the region&#39;s farms from excess water due to recent storms. In the technology sector, experts in artificial intelligence are being sought after, and in Spain people are finding a perfect balance of culture, art and nature for family trips. It appears our traditional values for writing is slowly declining with typing and texting replacing it, and our education system is seeing a shift too - with students being encouraged to think more deeply about their top college choices.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
