<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world, there are a few major things that have been happening lately. Israel is planning to withdraw some of their troops from Gaza. In Gaza, more than 90 percent of Palestinians have been going without food for at least one day according to the United Nations. Japan was rocked by an earthquake, seen on a map that showcased its epicenter and shaken area. In the US, there are a lot of new laws and regulations taking effect today on hot button issues. New York especially has a lot of new laws related to wages, health care, education, etc. that are going into effect in the coming months. On the cultural side, classic characters like Mickey Mouse have lost copyright protection and may never be the same. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a story of young love in Russia meeting repression- a couple married in a jail in Moscow! In politics, former president Trump has argued for absolute immunity after his acquittal from his second impeachment trial for inciting an insurrection. In lifestyle topics, energy levels can be improved in 2024 with a few steps taken to optimize our well-being. Finally, New Haven&#39;s pizza joints have been gaining attention as they try to stand out on the national stage among the many pizza places out there.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
