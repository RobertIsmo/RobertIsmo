<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, January 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there are a lot of tensions and conflict around the world. In Ukraine, Russia has waged a war and it is causing global starvation by blocking most shipments from the country. Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine is helping its economy to become even more powerful, which could affect other countries like India. Closer to home, states with looser gun laws have less power to respond to people with high powered weapons in public places. China&#39;s economy is struggling after the Coronavirus lockdowns but it&#39;s youth elite are still striving for government jobs- which may not be all they imagined. In Arkansas, there has been an emergency curfew due to violence stemming from a gun death on Christmas Eve. On a happier note, thousands of people queued up to pay their respects at the Vatican in Rome for Pope Emeritus Benedict when he was lying in state. In Washington, a graduate student who has been caught telling lies about his backgroundcalled George Santos will be sworn into Congress this week. Finally, there has been an ongoing debate about when life begins, which is relevant for the nation&#39;s abortion debate. Oh and of course Pelé died this week- his native city of Santos in Brazil is mourning especially deeply as his friends , family and neighbours remembered him with great fondness.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
