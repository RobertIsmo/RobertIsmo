<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>

Hey friend,

I&#39;ve seen some interesting news lately. There&#39;s a Supreme Court case involving the leak of a draft abortion opinion that was published by Politico in May. On the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion activists are debating what comes next. Evangelical leaders are wavering on whether or not to support Donald Trump in 2024. John Eastman is facing legal repercussions for his role in the effort to reverse Trump&#39;s election loss. Alec Baldwin will be charged with involuntary manslaughter for a gun that went off and killed a cinematographer on set, and the prosecutors are saying he had an &#39;absolute duty&#39; to check it. The US has hit its debt limit, so now Congress needs to lift or suspend it or else the US might run out of cash. With all this going on, Harvard also reversed its decision to grant a fellowship to an international human rights advocate who had criticized Israel, raising questions about donor influence and academic freedom. Finally, the pandemic has created some difficult divisions and tarnished the reputation of liberal leader Jacinda Ardern.

Hope all is good with you!</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
