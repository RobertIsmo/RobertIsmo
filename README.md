<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, December 21, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been quite a busy few weeks with news around the world. In Ukraine, President Zelensky is trying to ensure that the nation&#39;s fight against Russia doesn&#39;t become a partisan issue. Russia and its leader, Putin, are still pushing ahead with their efforts even as they admit to some challenges. Meanwhile, in the US, questions have been raised about why Donald Trump has yet to be audited by the IRS despite a mandatory presidential audit program. We also learned that Trump&#39;s history of questionable tax maneuvers continued through his presidency and he was unable to pay any income taxes in 2020. Elsewhere, millions of people in the US are bracing themselves as forecasters predict a &quot;once-in-a-generation&quot; snow storm this week. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has secured a governing coalition that if approved by Parliament, will return him back to power. And lastly, Jenna Bush Hager has been making waves in the publishing industry and some people have been anxiously waiting for the end of pandemic-era travel restrictions at the US border. On a sad note, Steeler Franco Harris passed away at 72 days before the 50th anniversary of what is likely one of the most memorable plays in NFL history: his famous &quot;Immaculate Reception&quot;.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
