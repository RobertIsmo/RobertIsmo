<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, July 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, it&#39;s a turbulent time in many parts of the world. In the US, affirmative action is winding down, and there&#39;s a lot of conversation about how to combat racism and privilege. On the international stage, troops in Ukraine are facing off against Russian forces, while in France, civil unrest continues over police violence against minorities. Meanwhile, environmental issues are happening right here in the US too - cities like Michigan have started to combat high levels of pollution. But aside from all that, there&#39;s still a lot of joy amidst all the chaos - for example, Olympic champion Caeleb Dressel has been gaining traction after his return to competitive swimming after taking a break for mental health reasons.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
