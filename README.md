<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the US, debates over the constitutionality of the debt limit are taking place as the government is facing imminent default. Democrats in the House are working on plans to increase the debt ceiling and prevent a default. Meanwhile, people are learning more about what exactly the debt ceiling is, and how large banks can be stable even during hard economic times. The Federal Reserve is also considering raising interest rates in light of new bank failures. Markets are fluctuating due to fears of further bank instability and a weaker economic outlook. In Hollywood, there is a writers&#39; strike affecting late night television shows. In Germany, Russian spies have been exposed engaging in covert operations on German soil which has lead to a Cold War-style chill between Berlin and Moscow. Moreover, South Korea still has to deal with its history of compelling women into prostitution for American soldiers from decades ago. On an environmental note, a new way of producing hydropower electricity -- known as pumped storage -- is gaining traction around the world. Lastly, former president Donald Trump is facing allegations of rape by author E. Jean Carroll and she is currently undergoing cross-examination by her legal team seeking to bolster her case.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
