<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 7, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is chaos happening all around the world. Wildfires are spreading across Canada and thick smoke is covering Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. In Russia and Saudi Arabia, there is a strain in their oil partnership, despite attempts to keep energy prices high for mutual benefit. The PGA Tour recently merged with LIV, but the effects of that merger are still up in the air. In New York, a Pizza Legend, Andrew Bellucci, died suddenly and his admirers have gathered to remember his life. In politics, Mike Pence and Doug Burgum have both announced their candidacies for the 2024 presidential election in the U.S., though Pence has little chance according to polls. Crypto firms are looking outside of the U.S. due to it becoming one of the world&#39;s strictest crypto regulators, which has resulted in Coinbase and Binance lawsuits shaking markets. Finally, in Sudan there is a &quot;dystopian nightmare&quot; unfolding in its battered Darfur region with hundreds killed since nationwide conflict began, raising fears of more wars and genocidal violence.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
