<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, the world is facing a lot of conflict. In Ukraine, progress against Russian forces has been slow and difficult even though the counteroffensive made some gains. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is appealing to the broader international community for support as a matter of global security. In the US, Garland will tell House Republicans that he is ‘not the president’s lawyer’ as they push for impeachment, and right-wing house republicans have derailed a GOP bill, creating a potential government shutdown. On an economic level, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to declare victory on inflation yet, but gas prices have risen significantly this summer. The UK also has lower inflation rate than the summertime peak over 3 months ago, but $100 oil could once again scramble economic trends. Finally, in Morocco there has been an earthquake which forced many people to use a perilous mountain pass for its lifeline. Additionally in South Africa, 77 people tragically died in an apartement fire, leaving many families missing their loved ones.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
