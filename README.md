<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, March 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hey, I wanted to tell you what&#39;s going on in the world right now. In the US, the governor of Florida is speaking out against a potential indictment against his likely presidential rival in 2024. Donald Trump is asking his supporters to protest his looming indictment, and Republicans are split on whether or not they should. Internationally, a UN report says that we could hit a critical global warming threshold within the next decade if we don&#39;t take immediate action. Here in the US, many states are scrambling over a pipeline project that would bury carbon underground and some people argue that it threatens property rights. Other reports say that climate change could potentially upend federal spending programs. In business news, there&#39;s uncertainty around one bank after its stocks plummeted and another is being operated by two New Yorkers. There&#39;s also a really interesting article about a package trip for millennials meant to create friendships - but it sounds kind of exhausting! In sports, there&#39;s an 88-year-old who is a secret weapon for one team, Rick Pitino is making a comeback as the coach of St John&#39;s after being ousted from Louisville, and some big matchups to look out for in March Madness. What do you think?</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
