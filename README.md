<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, February 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of interesting developments around the world recently. In the US, there is a diplomatic crisis over questions about whether a mysterious balloon sent by China was for surveillance and an effort to pass a bipartisan bill to condemn China for it. On top of that, the US is on track to add nearly $19 trillion in new debt in just 10 years, and the Congressional Budget Office warned there could be a government default as soon as July unless taxes come in. Over in Russia, there was a failed battle for the Ukraine city of Vuhledar that casts doubts on Moscow&#39;s military capabilities. Ukraine itself is preparing for massive rebuilding efforts and trying to move forward after tragedy. As far as news related to culture, we recently lost Raquel Welch, who was an actress and sex symbol in the 60s known mainly for her iconic bikini look in &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; Lastly, worldwide interest has been piqued over long held suspicions that Chilean poet Pablo Neruda might have been murdered by Chile&#39;s military dictatorship.</p>

<p>U.S. officials now suspect that the balloon was sent to spy on bases in Guam and Hawaii and that other downed objects were not surveillance machines. Washington’s evolving view reflects U.S. and Chinese difficulties in discerning each other’s intentions.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3HY5y9g"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
