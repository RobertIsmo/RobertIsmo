<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There seems to be a lot going on in the US these days! President Biden and the House Minority Leader are optimistic but still far apart on a debt deal. Joe Manchin is clashing with the Biden administration over climate laws, and Republicans have successfully overridden a veto by their Democratic governor to pass an abortion ban. On the other hand, there&#39;s some progress being made in race relations — San Francisco is proposing a nation&#39;s most ambitious reparations plan which includes cash payments and housing aid — while certain laws against lewdness are being utilized to support the fight for abortion rights. Right-wing platforms and politicians have been raising questions about the legitimacy of reports linking Hunter Biden to questionable activities, while experts debate should A.I. be regulated by the government. Even Native Americans are facing consequences from their past, which may change with a landmark Supreme Court case this spring. Finally, Tucker Carlson&#39;s controversial influence on mainstream conservative ideology is now waning after leaving Fox News.</p>

<h3>Without Tucker Carlson, Far Right Loses a Foothold in the Mainstream</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
