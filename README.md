<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Recently, there has been a lot of news activity around the world. In the United States, the Supreme Court ruled on an affirmative action case, which could change hiring practices at companies. Trump made a speech vowing to target diversity programs and investigate schools and corporations over alleged racial discrimination. Meanwhile in Florida, the governor made over one million dollars from his book plus disclosed that he is part of the millionaires club. 

France has been facing social unrest and division due to a police shooting of a teenager. Continuing protests have resulted in clashes between protesters and police all across France. 

The pandemic has also affected student loan payments in the US as they will soon no longer be paused and new calculations may lower monthly bills. Fox News has settled a hostile workplace lawsuit with a former producer.

On a more somber note, Alan Arkin--a comedic actor with a serious side--has passed away at 89 years old. He was known for roles in Broadway musicals as well as movies such as Little Miss Sunshine.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
