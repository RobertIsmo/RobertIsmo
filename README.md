<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, June 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there&#39;s a lot happening in the world. In Russia, Google News is blocked as a feud with a mercenary leader intensifies. In the ocean, 5 deaths at sea have highlighted harsh realities about ethnicity while the investigation into a submersible disaster continues. Meanwhile, in the US, Supreme Court rulings have addressed immigration laws, free speech challenges and abortion bans. There&#39;s also been a push to increase deep-sea travel and the president denounced abortion bans while an Arizona governor has blocked her state&#39;s 15-week ban on abortion procedure. Finally Barbie has attained her dreamhouse, evoking conversations related to American Dream.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
