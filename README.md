<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, March 30, Central Standard Time</p>
<p> 
There is a lot going on in the world right now. For example in Ukraine, Russian forces have been launching assaults on eastern cities and there has been a buildup of troops. This same situation led to the detainment of a Wall Street Journal reporter by Russia who has been accused of espionage. Mexico is also currently investigating the deaths of migrants in a fire at a detention center in Ciudad Juarez as a potential homicide case. In the US, Republicans are pushing laws to expand access to guns after recent mass shootings, while President Biden is pushing for action from Congress to combat gun violence. There is also an interesting story about a Chinese billionaire accused of fraud who turned his charms on America but is now being charged with the law catching up with him. Finally, immigration to top US counties has reportedly tripled even as many lost population, and Tokyo Olympics scandal may be impacting Sapporo&#39;s bid for the 20230 Winter Games.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
