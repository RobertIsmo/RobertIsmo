<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, February 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
The world is still in turmoil - war continues to ravage parts of Ukraine, the Syrian and Afghan conflicts are ongoing, and the specter of a nuclear Iran looms large. Meanwhile, China is launching programs to encourage people to have more children while they grapple with their declining birth rate and Albania has been the target of cyberattacks believed to be linked to Iran. Closer to home, Janet Yellen has made history as the first woman to lead the Treasury, but there are also heartbreaking stories of migrant children in America who are working brutal jobs in violation of child labor laws. In the US, we&#39;ve also remembered those affected by the 1993 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on its 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
