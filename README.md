<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, June 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on around the world recently. In Ukraine, Russia&#39;s ambitions there have been dealt a blow as the one major battlefield victory for Moscow this year was lost and a mercenary army called Wagner may be in doubt. In Russia itself, a mutiny by a mercenary leader had people asking if there is now a risk of Vladimir Putin losing power. The uncertainty has been felt across the nation, with neither Putin nor the Wagner leader making public appearances recently. On the US side of things, Donald Trump has created a PAC that has received donations to help cover his legal fees, while campaigning in Michigan which has become increasingly leaning Democratic in recent years. Recently too, Saudi Arabia welcomed Christian tourists, while Californians are celebrating the appearance of an immense lake where farms used to be. Recently in New York, at the Pride March there were overjoyed attendees yet also worries about L.G.B.T.Q rights. Kylie Minogue&#39;s latest single has become something of an anthem for Pride events and D.J.s are talking it up. Finally, one man who was handcuffed and hospitalized for serious mental illness is now on track for being placed in permanent housing as part of a contentious new policy for homeless people from New York City authorities, while adventurers can take to running through the Dolomites mountain range in Italy for an altitude-meeting-adrenaline thrill.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
