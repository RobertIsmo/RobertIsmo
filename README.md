<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, May 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Things in the world have been a bit turbulent recently. In the US, there&#39;s talks of paring back public assistance, and a lot of pressure from both sides of the aisle to continue sending weapons to Ukraine without asking for more money. There have been some tense political moves being made in Florida between Disney and the governor, Ron DeSantis. On the worldwide front, a blast in Russia&#39;s Crimea happened recently, likely carried out by Ukraine in retaliation for Russian aggressions. Ukraine is ramping up arrests against corruption as well. The Supreme Court has also made several legal stipulations recently about copyright issues, tech companies being liable for user posts, and an immigration measure tied to a pandemic issue.</p>
