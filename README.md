<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, October 10, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a lot of tension around the world. In Israel, Palestinian gunmen have raided an Israeli village and civilians have been injured in what is being called a &#39;massacre&#39;. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under pressure for his role and legacy in this conflict. In the US, Republicans are trying to figure out their choice for a new Speaker of the House. There is also broad consensus in Congress for assisting Israel in their fight against Hamas, but it&#39;s uncertain how that aid could look with the current political climate. On the tech front, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the FTX crypto exchange, is on trial for criminal fraud and is accused of directing his adviser, Caroline Ellison, to commit crimes. In Arizona, there is speculation over Kyrsten Sinema&#39;s reelection bid for Senate and if a three-way race could benefit Republican candidate Kari Lake. Meanwhile, Florida Governor DeSantis has been increasing his criticisms of former President Trump as he begins his own campaign for re-election. Closer to home, former baseball player Steve Garvey just announced that he will be running for Dianne Feinstein&#39;s California Senate seat. Finally, The New York Times has written about how culture appears to have reached a standstill when it comes to innovation - although not necessarily in a bad way - and how remote work has changed workers&#39; lives and shifted the economy over the past few years.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
