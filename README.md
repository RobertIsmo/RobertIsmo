<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, February 8, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s some big news happening around the world, from the US to China to Europe. In the US, President Biden is touting an ambitious agenda focused on big-government policies, and is looking to win back support from white working class voters. Meanwhile, in China, reports indicate they are launching spy balloons to surveil military sites around the world. In Europe, investigators suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin was likely involved in the crash of flight MH17.

Aside from that, there are some exciting developments in technology. Microsoft just made their search engine, Bing, even more powerful and useful with A.I. technology integration. But there&#39;s growing alarm surrounding the use of AI chatbots which can spread dubious information quickly.

In Japan, a softball team comprised mostly of former mobsters is getting attention as they try to dodge trouble and enjoy retirement. The sports world has also been buzzing over NBA great LeBron James&#39; latest accomplishments - breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#39;s scoring record - and looking at all the ways he can still score despite his age.

Finally, in music, singer SZA is reflecting on fame and success and we&#39;re learning chilling details about a mother who faces murder charges for killing her young children. Scientists are also uncovering impressive fossils that belonged to a giant bird which lived in New Zealand many years ago - the biggest penguin ever!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
