<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 15, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is a lot of news around politics and business in the world. In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is headed for his — and his country&#39;s — first presidential runoff vote due to his continued strength despite facing strong opposition. In the U.S., recent sanctions against Russia haven&#39;t been enough to stop American technology from being sent there, and North Carolina is voting on a possible abortion bill that could have huge implications for its citizens. Meanwhile, Paraguay&#39;s long-standing dominant party has been buying votes from Indigenous people to remain in power. Lastly, climate change is bringing warmer, wetter weather to islands like Trinidad and Tobago, which still rely heavily on fossil fuels as their main energy source.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
