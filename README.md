<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, August 22, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In the US, there are legal battles taking place against former President Trump and his allies regarding election interference in Georgia. We are seeing some conflict in Ukraine, where American strategists believe the troops are spread out over too wide an area. Families of those missing in Maui, Hawaii are desperately searching for their loved ones following devastating wildfires. Central US states have been sweltering under a heat dome, with precations needing to be taken to beat the heat. Meanwhile, Canadian officials have condemned Facebook for blocking news links while their country is dealing with its worst wildfire season ever. In Brazil, former president Jair Bolsonaro is facing multiple criminal charges, including one related to a Rolex gifted by Saudi Arabia that was bought at a mall in Pennsylvania. Lastly, there are quite a few Republicans who have announced they will be running for Presidency in 2024 despite having virtually no chance of beating Trump should he decide to run again. All these events leaving many wondering what will happen come debate time.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
