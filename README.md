<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, October 12, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there is tension in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, with former Israeli generals taking action. In terms of U.S. politics, Republican legislators are fighting over choosing a new speaker, and there is a court case involving the drawing of voting maps based on race and partisanship. In business news, air traffic control lapses have put many passengers at risk, while in music Usher is releasing new music that could redefine the genre. In New York City, people are debating whether free preschool should be offered to everyone or just those in need. NASA has also recently released its first glimpse of &quot;scientific treasure&quot; from a mission to an asteroid. Finally, there is a personal piece of writing about not being able to have children but feeling relieved.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
