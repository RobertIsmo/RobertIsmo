<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on around the world right now. In the US, former President Donald Trump has been indicted on election charges and he pleaded not guilty in court. Mike Pence has reached a fork in the road as he campaigns to persuade voters. Meanwhile, Ron DeSantis&#39; efforts in Iowa seem to be having an effect which might pose a challenge for Trump in the upcoming Iowa caucuses. Out of the country, Chris Christie made a surprise trip to Ukraine to support their efforts to repel Russia while in Russia, Aleksei Navalny is awaiting a verdict for charges that could extend his sentence by two decades. Closer to home, Nevada has the highest unemployment rate in the country and companies are struggling to hire people and control their wage growth. Finally, birders are facing increasing noise pollution which is interfering with their navigation.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
