<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, December 29, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It&#39;s been a busy news week all over the world. In Russia, there have been air attacks on Ukrainian cities resulting in the death of at least 26 people and damage to industrial and military infrastructure. People are also being prosecuted for speaking out against the war in Russia. On top of that, an associate of prominent political activist Aleksei A. Navalny has been given a nine-year prison sentence for “extremism”. On the other side of the world, Donald Trump is facing lawsuits from multiple states looking to have him disqualified from future primary ballots, and his rivals are already coming to his defense. In Maine, he was found ineligible to hold office due to his actions after the 2020 election, while California is keeping him on their primary ballot. Over in Ohio, Governor Mike DeWine vetoed a bill banning transition care for minors which also prohibited transgender girls and women from sports teams corresponding with their gender identity - a rare move for a Republican governor. Meanwhile, strawberry farmers in California are being asked to pay for water as part of an effort to conserve aquifers. Finally, back in the Middle East there has been what is being described as one of Israel&#39;s deadliest attacks on Gaza yet, as well as reports of weaponized sexual violence by Hamas against women in Israel.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
