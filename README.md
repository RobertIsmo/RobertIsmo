<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, April 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now! In the US, the Biden administration is trying to stop the use of some spyware tools made by an Israeli firm. At the same time, former President Trump has been indicted and is currently facing a criminal case. Meanwhile, in Finland their Prime Minister has been toppled in a tight election and the country&#39;s secret to happiness is being recognized. There are also severe storms predicted for tomorrow covering seven states from Texas to Illinois. And tragically, a popular Russian military blogger was killed in St. Petersburg due to a bombing. Finally, Seymour Stein, an influential producer who signed Madonna, recently passed away at 80.</p>

<h3>Trump Flourishes in the Glare of His Indictment</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
