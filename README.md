<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, June 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now there is a lot of political upheaval in the US, with Donald Trump being indicted on documents and obstruction charges, and the Southern Baptists trying to purge churches with female pastors. In the world, Russian forces are striking back against Ukraine&#39;s advancing troops, and in Colombia, children were rescued from a jungle where they had fled to escape recruitment by an armed group. Cormac McCarthy, an acclaimed novelist who explored bleak worlds of violence and outsiders, recently passed away at the age of 89.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
