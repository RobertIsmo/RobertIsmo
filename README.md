<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, January 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
To catch them up on the news, I&#39;d tell my close friend that in the US there are divisions in the House Majority as they fail to agree on a new speaker, and state politics are shaking up too with the New York representative being the first Black politician to lead either party in Congress. Also, a Republican candidate for office who has made false claims about his past is now in Washington DC.

On the sports front, there was a suspended NFL game due to a Bills safety going into cardiac arrest, but he&#39;s still in hospital. In addition, an important story in Russia is that President Putin is seems to be preparing Russians for a long fight ahead because of war with Ukraine.

Finally, the FDA has determined that abortion pills can now be offered at retail pharmacies, and some studies suggest that awe can improve one&#39;s overall health too.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
