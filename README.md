<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There has been a lot going on around the world lately! Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Biden are set to meet soon despite growing trade tensions, while Israel is dealing with the largest internal displacement in its history with 125,000 evacuees having to leave home. In the US, the drug crisis is becoming increasingly complex with people now being addicted to multiple substances, and Vermont is seeing a long-term labor shortage with older populations. Meanwhile, start-ups are looking to commercialize advances in fusion energy as a way to address climate change. Plus, US Senator Tim Scott has recently suspended his campaign for president due to failing to resonate with voters.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
