<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, April 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on around the world right now. In the US, there&#39;s a $2.6 billion package of military aid to Ukraine and a high stakes Supreme Court race in Wisconsin that could decide the future of abortion rights and gerrymandering in the state. Former president Donald Trump is facing 34 charges in connection with paying hush money to a porn star before the 2016 election. In Russia, a suspect has been charged with terrorism offenses in the killing of a pro-war blogger. Health studies have recently shown that moderate drinking has no health benefits at all - actually it increases risks to your health significantly if you drink more than two drinks a day for women or three for men. An AI start-up based in New York is developing technology that can produce short videos based on computer text input. On top of that, mass bison hunts are taking place in Yellowstone National Park to prevent them from spreading disease to livestock and there&#39;s a brand new Broadway musical by an old icon being released. Finally, there&#39;s an evaluation challenge from a professor at a university where students can get an A if their video gets over 1 million views!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
