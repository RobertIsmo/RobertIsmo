<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 5, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In the Ukraine Russia is waging trench warfare on the front line, and their troops and mercenaries are attacking from 3 directions. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis&#39;s legislative session is focusing on expanding gun rights. On a larger scale, Biden visited Selma to commemorate Bloody Sunday and remind people about the continued struggle of voting rights for minority populations. In terms of technology, Hungary is testing out new AI software to detect breast cancer. Meanwhile, experts in Paris are focused on restoring Notre Dame&#39;s glorious sound with an interactive project. Regarding business, personality tests are gaining more and more popularity to measure how employees think and feel while they work from home and also find out what type of &quot;office creature&quot; they are. Lastly in Ohio Island there is no ice, so when summer tourist season ends locals must find other ways to earn a living and have fun. Additionally men across the world are learning how to become better grandfathers without any cultural norms to guide them.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
