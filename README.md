<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, August 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, things are pretty intense across the globe. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned of a late-summer Covid wave and that there could be more to come. There are also a few election cases against former president Donald Trump that are expected to start this week. Here in the US there is also a hurricane forming that is expected to affect parts of Florida soon. Meanwhile, other countries are facing their own issues - in Spain there&#39;s outrage over a soccer official kissing a player after winning the Women&#39;s World Cup, in Russia there are lots of tributes being left for Yevgeny Prigozhin who was the founder of a private military company, and in Jacksonville police are investigating a shooting as a hate crime. It&#39;s really a lot happening right now!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
