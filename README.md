<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, May 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot going on in the world right now. The White House and G.O.P. are close to striking a deal to raise the debt limit and cut spending. Hakeem Jeffries, the new top Democrat in the House, is facing a tough test by dealing with the looming debt crisis. There have been reports of brutality, cheating, and drug use in Navy SEAL training programs, which have recently been brought to light. In Texas, there is an ongoing impeachment process against State Attorney General Ken Paxton for abuse of office. Meanwhile, a woman was push onto a train in New York City and is now in critical condition, exposing post-pandemic fears and challenges for New Yorkers. Mar-a-Lago workers are getting involved with court documents tied to former President Trump, and Wagner mercenary forces are leaving a city they invaded in Ukraine in order to give control back to Russia. Additionally, an Oath Keepers leader was sentenced to 18 years for sedition in relation to the Capitol attack while understanding the difference between sedition, insurrection and treason becomes more important. Lastly, Ron DeSantis&#39;s presidential campaign has raised $8.2 million in 24 hours which shows his strength to go up against Donald Trump.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
