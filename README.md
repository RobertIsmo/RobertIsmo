<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, January 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot happening in the world right now. In China, there is a crackdown on protesters who openly rebelled against the government for their &#39;zero Covid&#39; policies. In the US, President Biden is criticizing House Republicans for their views on economics which have sharpened a potential re-election message from the president. Businesses that hired more people and ramped up technology are now cutting back due to customers spending less money. The Republican National Committee is distancing itself from Trump&#39;s 2024 campaign but is still standing behind him in other ways such as helping Ukrainian soldiers fight back with pierogies and artillery shells. A golfer named Anthony Kim caused a stir when he decided to walk away from a career with no explanation, baffling sports experts who thought he would go far in golf. Winter weather this season has been mild compared to years before, and there was a mass shooting of farm workers in Half Moon Bay. The film industry has taken great strides to make more films with female leads, while three friends pooled their finances and bought a house together in Queens. And finally, there was an uproar from the literary community over controversial book publishing practices, and it highlighted the rising number of &#39;deaths of despair&#39;.</p>

<h3>He Was Compared to Tiger Woods. So Why Did He Walk Away From Golf?</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
