<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, November 20, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of developments in the world recently. Former US President Trump is now attacking his domestic political opponents with particularly hostile rhetoric, which is raising alarm bells about his authoritarian tendencies. On the business front, OpenAI staff are threatening to leave the company due to one board member&#39;s involvement in Sam Altman&#39;s ouster as chief executive, making the company&#39;s future uncertain. Microsoft&#39;s CEO, Satya Nadella, has saved the &#39;best bromance in tech&#39; by hiring Altman soon after his exit from OpenAI. In addition, US Courts have moved to drastically weaken the Voting Rights Act, and hostage families in Gaza are desperate for news of their loved ones. Meanwhile, satellite analysis shows that half of all buildings in northern Gaza have been destroyed or damaged since recent escalation of tensions in Israel and Gaza. Academics and writers at University of Arkansas must sign a pledge that they will not participate in any anti-Israel boycotts if they want to receive payment for speaking on campus. In Death Valley National Park, an incredibly rare lake has miraculously come to life. An investigation by The New York Times uncovered a series of disturbing failures relating to homeless mentally ill people that contributed to 94 acts of shocking violence across the state. Finally, citizens of Argentina are bracing themselves for their new &#39;anarcho-capitalist&#39; president Javier Milei - who has said society should be without government!</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
