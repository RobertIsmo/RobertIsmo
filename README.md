<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, May 23, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Currently, there’s a big focus on the intersection between mental health and social media use. The U.S. Surgeon General recently released a report saying it can be harmful for children and adolescents, and parents are being urged to set boundaries and monitor their kids&#39; use of it. The attention on this issue has also made people think about how to navigate social media platforms in general, since it’s such an important part of modern life. 

In politics, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is set to announce his 2024 presidential run on Twitter-he may be joined by Twitter’s owner, Elon Musk-and he just made comments on the Supreme Court that some have seen as an attempt to sway voters. In Arizona, a judge threw out a lawsuit that was filed by a political ally of Donald Trump who lost the governor’s race last year; her lawyers had argued that the county didn&#39;t properly review mail-in ballot signatures. 

Internationally, China has been strengthening its ties with Russia as Western countries begin paying more and more attention to what’s happening both in Asia and other places like Ukraine. The U.S. is helping Ukraine by sending fighter jets that its pilots need to be trained on, and Russia has detained an American journalist for nearly 3 months now. 

Closer to home, there’s been news around Catholic churches-namely that in Illinois alone over 1,900 minors have been abused by priests and religious brothers since 1950. Meanwhile, in Vienna people are looking at how rent control and other ideas have created a utopia of sorts where housing is affordable for all.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
