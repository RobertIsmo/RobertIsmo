<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Sunday, March 26, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
In the world right now, nations like China and the US are in an arms race, which can be a sign of escalating tensions. South Korea is filling in as an alternative weapons supplier but is being careful not to provoke Moscow. In addition, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has proposed putting tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus this summer. On the US side of things, former President Donald Trump has been under threat of indictment and spoke on it at his first major rally for 2024. 

On a more personal level, marriage rates in China have gone down due to its one-child policy and bridal prices have skyrocketed - creating financial stress on many families. Adult children are also having to take over their parents&#39; finances while juggling their own late twenties and thirties. It&#39;s definitely a challenging moment in every aspect.</p>

<h3>Donald Trump, and the Sordid Tradition of Suppressing October Surprises</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
