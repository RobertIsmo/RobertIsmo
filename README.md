<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, September 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting happenings in the world today. Recently, a New York judge ruled that Donald Trump committed fraud in valuing his real estate properties, and the Attorney General of New York is seeking to hold him accountable. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey has faced new bribery charges, and his case is going to trial. On the lighter side, TV and movie writers are about to return to work following a strike, and Stephen Sondheim&#39;s final musical will be performed soon.</p>
