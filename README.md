<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, September 2, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of interesting things happening in the world right now. In Ukraine, small-scale assault groups have been tasked to slowly push forward in their counteroffensive. Unfortunately, folk singer Jimmy Buffett recently passed away, but his influence and millions live on with his Broadway show, &quot;Escape to Margaritaville&quot;. Two proud boys have been sentenced for their role in the Jan 6 sedition case, while President Biden won&#39;t be meeting with Florida Governor DeSantis during his tour of hurricane damage. The remnants of Idalia, a former hurricane, could become a tropical or subtropical storm and is approaching Bermuda. Meanwhile Senator McConnell may be experiencing small seizures, which medical doctors suggest may indicate a serious illness. On the international front, Clément Beaune of France is trying to revive the center-left and build the united Europe he cherishes. Back in America, colleges are debating the impact of AI-generated admission essays and Hollywood strikes are also having a broad effect on jobs related to TV and film production. Finally, Mohamed al-Fayed, an egyptian tycoon whose son died with Diana, passed away at 94. Lastly, there&#39;s concern that a hard right immigration stance may inject itself into the spending fight in Congress and potentially cause shutdowns again going forward.</p>

<h3>A Brutal Path Forward, Village by Village</h3>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
