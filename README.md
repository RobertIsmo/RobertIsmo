<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Tuesday, February 28, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>There are a few major stories happening around the world. First, President Biden is proposing a student loan forgiveness plan that could reduce people&#39;s balances up to $20,000. Secondly, Europe&#39;s militaries are not prepared to stand up against Russia in Ukraine. China is also sending arms and ammunition to Russia, causing concern. In addition, the United Kingdom negotiated a trade deal with the European Union that could finally settle Brexit after 7 years of debate. In America, former President Jimmy Carter had complicated relationships with Black Americans and eventually gained their support. There is also a movie about the Russian presence in Ukraine that warns of a heavy price if the West fails to defeat Putin there. Lastly, Twitter outages are becoming more common and 23 whales have been found dead on the east coast since December.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
