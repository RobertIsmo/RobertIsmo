<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, December 19, Central Standard Time</p>

There is some difficult news coming out of China right now, as their leader appears to be suddenly abandoning their strategy to contain the coronavirus. In the US, a House panel investigating the Capitol attack is holding its final public session and they may refer criminal charges against Donald Trump. Reports are also surfacing about allegations of discrimination against gay people by the former head of NASA, and Elon Musk has put his future as CEO of Twitter up for a vote. Meanwhile, in Qatar, the heavily controversial World Cup tournament has been completed and Argentina finally won their first title in decades, while celebrations broke out across the country.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
