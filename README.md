<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Monday, May 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
It looks like the US might be running out of cash soon, but that President Biden is meeting with lawmakers to try and avoid a default. In the banking industry, First Republic Bank recently had a late-night handle of negotiations, which left JPMorgan in control. On the fashion front, people are gearing up for the 2023 Met Gala, where the highlight will be honoring the late Karl Lagerfeld. Meanwhile, U.S. prisons are struggling with lack of staff and have resorted to bringing in teachers and case managers to act as guards. Technology is advancing quickly, with &quot;the Godfather of A.I.&quot; leaving Google while cautioning us against its dangers.  On an international level, things are getting tense with Russia and Ukraine being involved in some hostile counterattacks. Politics-wise, Kyrsten Sinema is stirring up quite a storm by ditching her Democratic ties and a Republican primary battle between Mitch McConnell&#39;s man and a former Trump official is heating up. Finally, Vice may be headed for bankruptcy after struggling to find new buyers this year.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
