<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, July 27, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Hello friend! There’s a lot going on in the world right now, but I&#39;ll give you the highlights. Economically, the United States recently reported growth of 2.4% in the second quarter of the year despite indications earlier in the year that we might be headed for a recession. In terms of employment, unions are even getting involved to help recruit to try and meet the shortage of public sector workers who must work on-site.

On the political front, Donald Trump’s lawyers recently met with prosecutors as charges related to election interference loom while, internationally, Britain is facing criticism over it&#39;s weak sanctions program against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, which many claim gives oligarchs too much power.

In addition, climate change remains a huge issue with July set to break all records for warmest month and cities on the East Coast implementing emergency measures to prevent illness and deaths due to rising temperatures. Meanwhile President Biden is set to announce steps to help communities deal with extreme heat, although many also want him to take more action on climate change overall.

Finally, there have been some exciting sporting events recently: not only has Lindsey Horan delivered a moment of brilliance for the US in their victory against The Netherlands in the Women&#39;s World Cup 2023, but Team USA can advance to the Round of 16 if they win their upcoming game. 

So as you can see there’s a lot going on right now – much more than I could cover here!</p>

<h3>Life Under U.K. Sanctions: Chauffeurs, Chefs and $1 Million Allowances</h3>

<p>Despite tough talk, Britain’s new sanctions program against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has proved shaky. Some oligarchs have received generous exemptions.

<h3>How Big Is the Legacy Boost at Elite Colleges?</h3>

<p>In the same week as a civil rights inquiry into Harvard, new data shows legacies are slightly more qualified yet are four times as likely to get into top schools.  <a href="https://nyti.ms/3Kigj8e"><img src="https://developer.nytimes.com/files/poweredby_nytimes_30b.png?v=1583354208352" height="20"></a></p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
