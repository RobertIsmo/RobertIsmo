<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, August 18, Central Standard Time</p>
<p> 
There are a lot of news stories in the world right now. President Biden is hosting leaders of Japan and South Korea at Camp David in an attempt to present a united front in the face of an increasingly assertive China. Also, Donald Trump is the target of four separate criminal indictments, and his lawyers have asked for an April 2026 start date to his trial. Additionally, federal prosecutors have recommended prison terms for top Proud Boys leaders for their part in the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. There&#39;s also a lawsuit going through state court from Maui County against some of the world&#39;s largest oil and gas companies for fire risks related to climate change. Furthermore, Hawaii is scrutinizing Hawaiian Electric for its role in an incredibly deadly blaze, and Maui&#39;s emergency management chief resigned over questions regarding response to this wildfire. On a somewhat brighter note, one person is trying to save a species from extinction by teaching them how to migrate via ultralight aircraft given climate change-related issues. However, Ukraine&#39;s situation is complicated as some citizens are refusing military services in the face of objections from the government. Finally, geopolitics are making clean energy development difficult because of China&#39;s nickel plant investments in Indonesia, which have caused both economic opportunity and environmental pollution.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
