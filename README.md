<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Wednesday, March 1, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There have been a lot of conflicts and changes around the world recently. In southeastern Ukraine, Russia was routed in an Epic Battle of Tanks, and Ukraine has sent reinforcements to the embattled city of Bakhmut. In the US, Mayor Lori Lightfoot lost her bid for re-election, while in Chicago Paul Vallas has risen from an also-ran to front-runner in the mayoral race. A revolutionary stroke treatment has been developed and will save millions of lives eventually. Additionally, an Israeli raid to capture Palestinian gunmen has caused one of the most violent encounters in the West Bank in decades, and an immigrant train crashed in Greece killing at least 36. Jurors have also visited a crime scene in South Carolina for a murder trial.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
