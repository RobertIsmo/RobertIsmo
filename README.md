<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, November 16, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
Right now, there is a subtle shift in the power balance between US President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, with Xi desperately needing things from the US for the first time in years. China is attempting to prove its good will by saying they may continue to send giant pandas to America. There was also a trial of a man obsessed with online conspiracy theories who broke into Nancy Pelosi&#39;s house and assaulted her husband with a hammer. Across the US, there&#39;s a lot of activity happening around politicians - Representative George Santos won&#39;t be seeking re-election after House panel evidence of crimes, and he had been using donor money on expensive items for himself like Ferragamo shoes. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been weaponizing their power of the purse as Covid relief bills get passed. In terms of tech platforms, Jewish celebrities and influencers are confronted TikTok executives in a private call about pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel content appearing on the site. Videos about Osama bin Laden’s criticism of the US have become popular on the same platform. On another platform, X (which is owned by Elon Musk) is facing backlash after he endorsed an antisemitic post, leading IBM to pull its advertising from that website and employees struggling over what to tell other advertisers. In entertainment news, Sean Combs has been accused by singer Cassie of rape and years of abuse in a lawsuit, while the FBI ran raids at homes belonging to an Adams aide and former Turkish airline official. Finally, there are more seniors than ever before choosing pot over pills due to suggestion of medicinal benefits from cannabis use as we age.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
