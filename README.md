<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Saturday, March 4, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot happening in the world right now! In Ukraine, their helicopter brigades are continuing to fight against the odds in their ongoing war effort. Meanwhile, North Carolina has seen a 37% rise in abortions since the overturn of the constitutional rights to abortion and Walgreens is not offering the abortion pill Mifepristone in 21 conservative states due to threatened legal action. A legal quirk has left officials with little or no authority to protect insects, which is a growing problem for humans. Companies are trying to maintain fat profits by making &quot;premiumization&quot; their new favorite buzzword in the economy while a protester was shot and killed near Atlanta at a police and fire training center. Donald Trump is getting ready to battle it out in the primary election while Pamela Smart, a woman convicted after her teenage lover killed her husband, is now hoping to get mercy from New Hampshire. Additionally, a couple in Singapore has been fined $17,000 for running an adult Telegram account and Tom Sizemore, an intense actor with a troubled life, recently passed away at 61. Lastly, The New York Times News Quiz for March 3 is out where you can test your knowledge of recent news stories.</p>
