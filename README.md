<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, April 13, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are a lot of important developments happening across the world right now. In the United States, a court is imposing temporary restrictions on an abortion pill that can remain available, and there is an online market for unregulated abortion pills arising to meet demand. In Russia, newly leaked documents are showing wide-ranging infighting among officials, and there is evidence of pro-Russian content being spread in Africa. There was also a near shoot down incident involving a British spy plane that was more serious than originally reported, and jury selection has begun for a landmark trial against Fox News that could affect libel law. Japan is facing pressure from China to free several of its citizens who have been locked up on spy charges, and in the US senators like Dianne Feinstein are being pressured to resign from powerful committees.</p>

<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
