<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Friday, July 14, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There is a lot going on in the world right now. In US politics, the fate of a defense bill comes down to social issues, and senators have proposed bipartisan legislation about UFO records. On the entertainment side, Hollywood actors and writers are on strike against big-name studios, and Fran Drescher, who was the star of a 1990s sitcom, is now leading the union. In health news, a World Health Organization agency has said that aspartame may have carcinogenic qualities. Politically, prosecutors are looking into whether former US President Donald Trump knew his efforts to stay in power were based on lies, and his super PAC paid Melania Trump for a &quot;speaking engagement.&quot; Additionally, prosecutors have pushed back on Trump&#39;s motion to delay documents trial until after Election Day.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
