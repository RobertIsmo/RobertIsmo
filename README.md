<h1>Beyond the tech, we all need a sense of storytelling.</h1>
<p>storytelling is more than just narrative and emotion. To convey a good story you must know your audience. It's about understanding interests, values, and beliefs and using them to create a story that resonates. It's about presenting information in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It's about creating an emotional connection with the those experiencing it...</p>
<p>That's it! it is about experience. So what are we experiencing now?</p>
<h2>What is happening in the world?</h2>
<p>It is Thursday, August 31, Central Standard Time</p>
<p>
There are some big events happening around the world right now. In the US, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. face scrutiny regarding travel and financial disclosures, while former President Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty in a case surrounding the interference of the 2020 election in Georgia. Meanwhile, Proud Boys Lieutenant Joseph Biggs has been sentenced to 17 years in prison as part of sedition charges from the US Capitol attack in January. Additionally, New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing President Trump for inflating his assets by $2.2 billion. In South Africa, a building which was once an apartheid checkpoint has burned down and in Ukraine an old German tank is replacing their current weapons systems. Over in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Idalia is tracking and is expected to be absorbed by Hurricane Franklin-- making 3 named storms over there. Lastly, Pope Francis recently released some statements regarding the state of the Catholic Church in America and how conservative American Catholics have a narrow view of their mission and reject change.</p>

<p>What emotions did you feel reading all of this? Does any of it hit close to home? Does the data presented to you have some type of impact?</p>
<p>I am Robert Ismo, I am a Backend Developer, I currently work at <a href="https://gnomic.education/">Gnomic</a>, I build education software. The experiences I create will touch a lot of people; understanding the impact that it will have and the stories people will create is one of the most important aspect of my job.</p>
<p>Building is equally artful as it is technical. I hope we all can build extremely cool things, and share them with the world.</p>
